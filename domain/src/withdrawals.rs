//! `withdrawals` bounded context — on-chain withdrawals out of the fund.
//!
//! The claim debited is always an investor's own ([`WithdrawalSource::User`]). The fund's
//! earnings used to leave by a second source — the revenue payout — which #245 retired:
//! every fee is the `fee` allocation's, held by people, and cash leaves it only through a
//! holder's redemption onto their own claim and then their own withdrawal.
//!
//! A withdrawal moves that claim out of the fund and onto an external
//! address. It is the **dangerous direction** (value leaves the system), so it is a
//! saga with an explicit queue. The gross amount is *reserved* against the user's
//! claim the instant the request is recorded — into the network-agnostic
//! `WithdrawalClearing` account, so **acceptance never depends on a specific rail's
//! liquidity**. A request therefore starts **`Queued`**; it is **`Dispatched`** to
//! custody (→ `Processing`) as soon as the chosen rail has liquidity — immediately on
//! the happy path, or later (the treasury worker) when that rail was short. It then
//! **settles** (`Completed`, on N confirmations) or **fails** (`Failed`, voided +
//! refunded). A still-queued withdrawal can be **cancelled** (`Cancelled`, voided +
//! refunded) — always safe, since nothing was broadcast. The cardinal rule — *never
//! void once the broadcast may have reached the chain* — is why `fail` is only legal
//! from `Processing` and `cancel` only from `Queued`.
//!
//! Pure and wasm-safe: ids are minted by the application layer, no clock, no I/O.
//! The relay maps each event to ledger ops (and the custody broadcast); that
//! orchestration lives in the adapter, never on this aggregate.
