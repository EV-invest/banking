//! `fees` bounded context — the fund's management + performance fee ("2 and 20").
//!
//! Two charges sit on a holding, and they answer different questions:
//!
//! - **Management, 2% p.a.** — rent on the capital the investor has parked in the
//!   product. It accrues *continuously* with elapsed time and is charged on every
//!   assessment, whether the fund made money or not. Its base is a
//!   [`ManagementBasis`]: the **invested capital** (the position's cost basis — the
//!   "static money" that actually went in) by default, or the **market value**
//!   (`units × NAV`, the hedge-fund convention). Invested capital is the house
//!   default because it is the number the investor agreed to: it does not swell with
//!   a mark the manager posted, which keeps the fee the manager earns independent of
//!   the input the manager supplies.
//! - **Performance, 20% of the gain** — a share of profit above a **per-investor
//!   high-water mark**, crystallized at the end of a [`CrystallizationPeriod`]
//!   (annual by default) and again on the day an investor redeems. Optionally the
//!   gain must first clear a **hurdle** accruing at `hurdle_bps` p.a. over the mark.
//!
//! ## Why the mark is per investor, not per fund
//!
//! A fund-level mark (what an on-chain vault must use, because a share token cannot
//! remember who bought when) mutualizes the fee: an investor who subscribes after a
//! drawdown rides the recovery fee-free, while one who subscribed at the top pays on
//! gains that only restored their own loss. The industry's two fixes are *series
//! accounting* (a new share class per dealing day) and *equalization* (per-investor
//! credits and debits against one class). This context takes the third road the ledger
//! here makes cheap: the position projection already exists per `(user, service)`, so
//! the mark simply lives on it. Every investor's fee is measured against their own
//! entry price, and nobody subsidises anybody.
//!
//! ## Why the fee is taken in units, never in cash
//!
//! A charge is settled by **clawing back units** — `Dr FeeShares / Cr UserShares` on
//! the Share ledger — never by moving USDT. Three properties follow, and they are the
//! reason for the design:
//!
//! 1. **No chain fee, ever.** Nothing leaves custody when a fee is charged, so the
//!    fund pays no gas per investor per period. The manager converts an accumulated
//!    unit balance to cash *once*, in bulk, via [`FeeSettlement`].
//! 2. **An investor can never be pushed negative.** The cash claim is not touched at
//!    all, and the clawback is capped by the units actually held — with TigerBeetle's
//!    `credits_must_not_exceed_debits` flag on `UserShares` as the ledger backstop
//!    underneath the application cap.
//! 3. **Other investors are untouched.** `SharesOutstanding` does not move, so NAV per
//!    unit is unchanged. The charge is a transfer *between holders*, not a dilution of
//!    everyone — which is what makes the per-investor mark honest.
//!
//! Whatever cannot be collected (the holder's units are locked by a queued redemption,
//! or the residue below one base-unit of share) is carried as
//! [`PositionSnapshot::debt`] and collected on the next assessment. It is never written
//! off and never turns into a negative balance.
//!
//! Pure and wasm-safe: no clock, no I/O, ids minted by the application layer.
