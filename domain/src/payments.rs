//! `payments` bounded context — moving money between two named ends of the platform.
//!
//! # This is an ORDER, not a second saga
//!
//! A [`PaymentOrder`] is **intent + approvals + outcome**. It is deliberately NOT a second
//! money saga beside [`crate::withdrawals::Withdrawal`]: that one owns the
//! `Queued → Processing → Completed | Failed | Cancelled` lifecycle, a `clearing` reserve
//! and the cardinal rule ("never void once the broadcast may have landed"). Folding an
//! on-chain payout's five states into this aggregate would mean either duplicating
//! `WithdrawalState` in a second table — which the header of `0025_consilium.sql` rejects
//! outright — or stopping at [`PaymentState::Executed`] while the screen claims the money
//! has arrived when it is still in a queue.
//!
//! So an executed order produces EITHER a withdrawal id OR one ledger fact, and records
//! only which ([`PaymentEffect`]). The machinery behind each stays in the application
//! layer, exactly as it does for a consilium's effect.
//!
//! # The three tiers, and why the caller never picks one
//!
//! [`PaymentTier`] is a pure function of the destination:
//!
//! | destination | tier | effect |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | an external wallet address | [`PaymentTier::External`] (L1) | a [`crate::withdrawals::Withdrawal`] |
//! | a product's pooled claim (`service:<id>`) | [`PaymentTier::Service`] (L2) | one posted transfer |
//! | any other internal claim | [`PaymentTier::Internal`] (L3) | one posted transfer |
//!
//! A caller-supplied tier would be a second statement of a fact the destination already
//! makes, and the interesting failure is the one where the two disagree — a request that
//! names an external address and asks for the internal tier. Deriving it means there is no
//! second statement to disagree with, which is also why the `payments` table has no `tier`
//! column: the projection cannot drift from the terms if it does not exist.
//!
//! # Authorization is a function of the SOURCE
//!
//! > Every payment whose source is fund-owned (`Piggybank`, `Revenue`, `Service`) requires
//! > the owner consilium, at every tier. Every payment out of `User(u)` requires `u`'s own
//! > consent, at every tier.
//!
//! [`PaymentTerms::requirement`] is that rule, and it is total over [`Party`] by
//! construction ([`Party::is_fund_owned`]). There is **no** "an admin may move money
//! between fund-owned claims alone" cell: a security review found it turns three
//! pre-existing single-actor holes into a treasury-wide one, and deleting it is what makes
//! payments add no new capability to an attacker. Do not reintroduce it.
//!
//! Pure and wasm-safe: ids and the payload hash are supplied by the application layer, no
//! clock, no I/O, no crypto.
