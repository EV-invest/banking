//! `balance` bounded context — the platform's money, and where it sits.
//!
//! The platform ("piggybank") custodies all value; **every unit of it has a holder** — a
//! person, directly through their claim, or through units of an allocation whose holders
//! are people (issue #245). Two views, both authoritative in TigerBeetle (the data
//! plane); this context is the **pure, wasm-safe** model of the chart of accounts and
//! the parties — no I/O, no `tigerbeetle` types leak in.
//!
//! - **Custody / treasury** (debit-normal): where value physically is — a crypto
//!   wallet per [`Network`] (the per-rail liquidity), plus a mocked bank account.
//!   Assets the platform holds. This is the **only** layer where network lives.
//! - **Claims** (credit-normal, **network-agnostic**): whose value it is — a user's
//!   claim (`UserClaim`), an allocation's pooled funds (`ServiceClaim`, the reserved
//!   `fee` and `fund` allocations included), and queued-withdrawal funds
//!   (`WithdrawalClearing`). USDT is one fungible pool, so a user has ONE claim, not
//!   one per chain. There is no claim without an owner: the platform's own capital is
//!   the `fund` allocation's claim, its earnings the `fee` allocation's, and both are
//!   held by people through units.
//!
//! A management/performance fee never touches either layer while it is being charged:
//! it moves *units* on the Share ledger, from the holder's `UserShares` to the product's
//! fee class, `FeeShares` — the units the `fee` allocation holds in that product. Only
//! the periodic bulk settlement of accumulated fee units crosses into cash, `Dr
//! ServiceClaim / Cr ServiceClaim(fee)`: the product buys its fee class back from the
//! `fee` allocation at the day's NAV. Every other fee the platform charges — the
//! retained withdrawal fee, the book's taker fee — is paid to the same claim; the
//! event that raises a fee names its payee ([`Party::fee_payee`]).
//!
//! **Retired accounts.** The `fund` (code 1) and `fee` (40) claims and the company stake
//! (63) were claims and holdings with nobody behind them. The data migration emptied them
//! and the contract step (C-9) removed their keys; the accounts themselves stay in
//! TigerBeetle and in `tb_accounts`, at zero, and their codes are reserved forever
//! ([`AccountCode::is_retired`]).
//!
//! The secondary market (the allocation **book**) adds two escrow accounts: `BookShares`
//! holds a holder's units while a sell order rests, `BookCash` holds a user's USDT while a
//! buy order rests. Both are per user, so what a user has committed to the book is a
//! balance the ledger keeps, never a figure Postgres reasons about — and a fill is one
//! linked batch moving units and cash out of the two escrows at once.
//!
//! Two layers, one invariant: **`sum(custody) == sum(claims)`** globally on the USDT
//! ledger. Per-rail backing is a *treasury* concern (a withdrawal on a short rail is
//! queued, not refused), not a ledger one — which is why the invariant is global, not
//! per-network. A deposit is one balanced transfer `Dr WALLET:<net> / Cr <claim>`
//! (textbook Dr Cash / Cr customer-deposit); network rides on the transaction, never
//! on the claim. There is no "external world" account.
