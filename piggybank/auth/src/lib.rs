#![feature(default_field_values)]
//! The hub's auth — a service **and** a shared verification flow.
//!
//! Two facets, one crate. Pick the half you need:
//!
//! # For the hub (`piggybank-core`)
//!
//! - [`AuthService`] runs as its own task inside the composition root. It owns the
//!   signing keys / JWKS / refresh store and serves the money-plane **issuance** gRPC
//!   routes (`IssueUserToken`/`Refresh`/`Logout`/`Jwks`). This is the money plane: it
//!   does NO third-party (Google) OAuth — users are mirrored from concierge by the
//!   one-way bridge, and `IssueUserToken` mints the money pair for an already-identified
//!   user (resolved over the [`Provisioner`] channel, auth → core). It answers core's
//!   authorize requests over the [`Authorizer`] channel (core → auth). Both channels
//!   cross a task boundary, never the network.
//! - Core mounts [`grpc_auth_layer`]`(authorizer)` on each data service to
//!   authorize inbound gRPC; handlers read the verified [`Claims`] with
//!   [`claims_of`].
//!
//! # For a downstream service (a separate repo)
//!
//! - Depend on `evbanking_contracts` (the gRPC stubs) and this crate.
//! - Build a [`Verifier`] from [`VerifierConfig`] and mount
//!   [`grpc_auth_layer`]`(verifier)` — it verifies the hub's tokens **locally**
//!   against the cached JWKS (no per-request round trip, no per-service token
//!   storage; a per-service denylist is an anti-pattern).
//! - Authenticate your own onward calls into the hub with a
//!   [`ServiceTokenSource`] (a `typ=service`, distinct-`aud` token).
//!
//! Tokens are short-TTL asymmetric JWTs (EdDSA/Ed25519); revocation is short TTLs
//! with refresh rotation, plus a `token_version` claim enforced at refresh. See
//! `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `piggybank/auth/README.md`.
//!
//! This crate is **wasm-unsafe** (crypto backend + tonic), so it must never be a
//! dependency of the wasm-safe `domain` crate.
