//! Unit issuance use cases — an operator minting fund units **in kind**.
//!
//! The one supply path beside [`subscribe`](super::funds::subscribe), and deliberately
//! shaped like it: the registry is resolved first, the mint is priced at a fresh NAV,
//! the cap is checked against what the ledger says is issued, and the relay posts the
//! units after the control-plane commit. What differs is what is *absent* — no cash
//! leg, no claim read, no access gate — because the operator is not an investor
//! spending a balance: they are recording that a holder owns a share of an asset the
//! product was registered against.
//!
//! Admin-only at the boundary (`Permission::AllocationManage`). The allocation must be
//! registered but may be in any state: a product sized and seeded before it opens is the
//! normal case, and a closed one may still need its cap table corrected.
//!
//! [`retire_units`] is the mint's mirror — a holder's units burnt with no cash leg —
//! with a Read-First on what the holder has free and a closed-door gate that `force`
//! overrides. The hand-over out of the company's stake (`TransferCompanyStake`) is
//! retired with the company holder itself (#245): the RPC is gone from the contract, and
//! the rows it wrote stay readable.
//!
//! **The reserved allocations are not the operator's to mint.** `fee` and `fund` are the
//! platform's own money, held by people (#245); a unit of either dilutes every holder
//! already there, and who holds the owners' money is the owners' call, not one
//! administrator's. [`issue_units`] and [`retire_units`] therefore refuse a reserved
//! `service` outright, and the one door that mints reserved units — [`grant_units`] — is
//! reached only as the effect of an executed holder-grant consilium (and by the one-off
//! data migration that seats the first holders). A holder LEAVES a reserved allocation by
//! redemption at its NAV, never by an operator's burn.
//!
//! A mint also flips the product's backing to `in_kind` (see
//! [`AllocationBacking`](domain::allocations::AllocationBacking)): the units it creates
//! have no cash in the fund's claim, so the redeem path has to know before the first
//! holder asks to be paid out of it.
