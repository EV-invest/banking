//! Wallet query use cases — a user's unified balance, deposit rails, and per-rail
//! withdrawal options.
//!
//! The user has **one** network-agnostic claim; the wallet presents it segmented by
//! lifecycle. Read-First: `available`, `pending_withdrawal`, and the cash side of `total`
//! all come live from the **same** TigerBeetle claim balance (the authoritative data
//! plane) — `available = posted − reserved`, `pending_withdrawal = reserved`, so
//! `available + pending_withdrawal == posted` by construction and the figures cannot
//! drift. `invested` is the sum of active stakes (a Postgres projection valued at NAV).
//! Network re-enters only as a transaction attribute: a per-rail deposit address and a
//! per-rail withdrawable view
//! (`instant = min(available, rail liquidity)`, the accept-and-queue degradation hint).
//!
//! Only **configured** rails (those with a running on-chain watcher) are presented or
//! provisioned at all: an unconfigured rail is omitted entirely — never provisioned,
//! not merely "address pending" — because a deposit sent to an address no watcher
//! scans is stranded, not credited.
