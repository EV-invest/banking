//! Payment use cases — open, read and withdraw an order (operators); the emailed consent
//! invitation and answer (no session); and the execution that turns an approved order into
//! a withdrawal or one settled transfer.
//!
//! The order is the INTENT plus its one approval plus its outcome; the money moves either
//! through the ordinary withdrawal saga (L1) or through the relay from the two events the
//! order drains (L2/L3). Which approval an order needs is read off its source —
//! [`PaymentTerms::requirement`] — and this module is where each requirement is actually
//! seated: a consilium opened over the order for fund-owned money, a consent credential
//! minted for the investor whose claim is spent.
//!
//! Execution is driven from three places — the carrying vote or consent, and the sweeper —
//! and is safe to reach more than once from each: only an `approved` order executes, the
//! payload hash and the consent pins are re-read first, an L1 withdrawal's id is a pure
//! function of the order so a retry re-creates the same row, and an L2/L3 settlement is
//! recorded only once the relay has actually applied the reservation it posts.
