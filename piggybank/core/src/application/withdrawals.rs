//! Withdrawal use cases — request + cancel (user), dispatch/settle/fail (operator),
//! list (user).
//!
//! `request_withdrawal` is a command with a **two-part Read-First**: it gates on the
//! user's money-out standing — not frozen (a concierge SUSPENDED or a banking
//! `DisableUser`) and KYC-verified — read through the same [`OutflowPolicy`] the dispatch
//! re-check uses, confirms the **available** unified claim
//! (posted − already-reserved) covers the gross (user solvency; the TB non-negative
//! flag is the backstop), then checks the **chosen rail's liquidity** — the min of the
//! TB rail accounting balance and the custody adapter's real on-chain treasury view —
//! and dispatches immediately when it covers the net, otherwise the withdrawal is
//! accepted and left `Queued` for the [`Dispatcher`](crate::infrastructure::dispatcher)
//! worker (or the admin `dispatch_withdrawal`) to send once the rail is topped up.
//! Admission is therefore NOT the last word on policy: `dispatch_withdrawal` re-evaluates
//! the kill-switch, the freeze and the tier-1 floor at the moment the money leaves, so a
//! pause, an AML hold or a revoked verification landing on an already-queued withdrawal
//! still stops it — whichever path (sweep or admin RPC) reaches it first. The tier floor
//! specifically is the deployment's [`KycGate`] (enforced by default), and the SAME value
//! must reach both points: a gate lifted only at admission would accept withdrawals that
//! dispatch then parks indefinitely.
//! `settle`/`fail` are the operator/watcher-driven
//! completions (admin-gated at the boundary), standing in for a chain watcher + custody
//! confirmation callback; `cancel` (user) refunds a still-queued withdrawal. The
//! cardinal rule — fail (void) only when the broadcast certainly did not land — is why
//! `fail` is only legal once `Processing`, while a `Queued` one is always safe to cancel.
