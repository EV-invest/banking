//! Allocation registry use cases — the catalog of investable products.
//!
//! Pure control plane: nothing here touches TigerBeetle or the relay, so no handler
//! notifies it. The write side is Admin/Owner-gated at the service boundary
//! (`Permission::AllocationManage`); the read side is open to any authenticated user,
//! filtered to what that user may see, with the unrestricted view behind the same
//! permission.
//!
//! [`require_subscribable`] / [`require_redeemable`] are the reason the context exists:
//! they are the gate the fund use cases run before any money moves, turning "this slug
//! parses" into "an operator registered and opened this product — and let this
//! investor in". The two are asymmetric on purpose: the subscribe gate consults the
//! caller's access, the redeem gate never does.
