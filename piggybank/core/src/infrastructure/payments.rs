//! Postgres adapter for the [`PaymentRepository`] and [`PaymentFeed`] ports.
//!
//! THE TRANSACTION BOUNDARY IS THE METHOD, and it never reaches TigerBeetle. Each method
//! opens one transaction, takes the source claim's advisory lock and/or the order's row lock,
//! applies the aggregate command inside it, and drains the resulting events to `event_log`
//! (always) and `outbox` (only for the two that move money). The relay then issues the
//! transfers after the commit — Write-Last, exactly as every other money aggregate here.
//!
//! [`PaymentRepository::submit`] is the load-bearing method: the attempt counter, the code
//! comparison and the order's transition all happen under ONE `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the
//! `payments` row. Counting the attempt *before* comparing (and in the same transaction) is
//! what stops concurrent guesses slipping past the five-attempt ceiling; locking the ORDER
//! rather than the consent row is what stops the answer and the transition landing in two
//! transactions a retry could interleave.
//!
//! Runtime queries (`sqlx::query*`, never the compile-time macros) keep `cargo build`
//! independent of a live database; sqlx 0.9 takes only a `&'static str`, so every column list
//! is spliced in with `concat!` rather than built with `format!`.
