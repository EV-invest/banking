//! Shared chain-rail plumbing — the pieces the EVM, TON and Tron rails would otherwise
//! carry in three verbatim copies.
//!
//! Each rail runs the same background shapes (deposit watcher, withdrawal watcher, treasury
//! sweep) against a different protocol. Their failure taxonomies, their wall clock, and the
//! sweep's Postgres/signer plumbing are identical — only the network name and the protocol
//! RPC differ — so they live here once, parameterised by `network: &str`, and a fix lands in
//! one place instead of three.
//!
//! What deliberately stays per-rail: the RPC clients and their `RpcError` enums (one per
//! protocol), the node error-string classifiers (`is_idempotent` matches different node
//! wording on EVM and Tron), the signing calls, and every `info!`/`warn!` the rails emit.
//! Logging stays home on purpose: `tracing` derives an event's `target` from the module it is
//! written in, and that target is both serialised into the JSON logs and what `RUST_LOG`
//! filters on. Hoisting the sweep loop's logs here would collapse
//! `piggybank_core::infrastructure::{sweep,ton_sweep,tron_sweep}` into one target and cost
//! operators the ability to filter or alert on a single rail.
