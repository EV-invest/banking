//! Reconciliation — the PG-vs-TB discrepancy scan (TB always wins).
//!
//! The outbox relay can **park** a money-moving event into a distinct terminal state
//! (`outbox.parked_at`, see [`super::outbox`]) when it hits a non-retryable failure. A
//! parked event is no longer dropped, but it still needs a watcher: this periodic job is
//! the design's reconciliation seam (PATTERNS.md § Reconciliation). It asserts four
//! things and **alerts** (a Sentry-shipped `error!`) on any drift, without mutating money
//! — TB is authoritative, so recovery is an operator/treasury action, not an auto-write:
//!
//!   1. **Global cash invariant** — `sum(custody) == sum(claims)` on the USDT ledger,
//!      read straight from TigerBeetle ([`Ledger::cash_invariant`]), the claims broken
//!      down by whose they are: `Σ user + Σ service + clearing + book cash + retired
//!      == Σ custody`. The retired `fund`/`fee` singletons count as claims — what is on
//!      them until the ownership data migration is legitimate, not drift — and value on
//!      an account of no known kind is its own finding.
//!   2. **Clearing vs control-plane** — the `clearing` account's reserved (pending +
//!      posted) balance vs the gross of every `queued`/`processing` withdrawal in
//!      Postgres; a mismatch means a withdrawal whose reserve parked (nothing locked) or a
//!      stranded reservation.
//!   3. **Every unit at a holder, per allocation** (#245) — for each allocation the
//!      registry knows, `Σ holder units == SharesOutstanding` read off the Share ledger
//!      ([`ownership_app::allocation_ownership`]). Double entry makes this hold by
//!      construction, so a mismatch is an inconsistency: an alert. Alongside it, **value
//!      without a holder** — cash or product units on an allocation no unit of which is
//!      outstanding — is a `warn!` and a counter
//!      ([`telemetry::note_unheld_allocation_value`]), NOT an alert: it is the expected
//!      state of `fee` between the first ownership release and the data migration that
//!      seats its holders, and should be zero everywhere after.
//!   4. **Parked-row scan** — every `outbox.parked_at` row, surfaced with its
//!      `last_error` and whether it has been flagged for compensation.
//!
//! It is **read-only** and idempotent, so running it on every standby is harmless; it is
//! wired as one `select!` branch of the composition root next to the relay.
