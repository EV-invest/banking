//! Cross-plane lifecycle bridge — the consumer side of the ONE-WAY identity→money seam.
//!
//! A single background task periodically PULLS `UserLifecycleEvent`s from the concierge
//! plane (`UserEvents.PullUserLifecycle`, authenticated with the shared
//! `BRIDGE_SERVICE_TOKEN`) and applies each to the banking `users` control plane, so a
//! concierge SUSPENDED/REINSTATED/KYC/revoke is mirrored here and money ops can be gated.
//! Concierge never calls banking — banking pulls.
//!
//! Delivery is at-least-once, so the consumer is idempotent:
//!   - dedupe + ORDER by the per-user `sequence` — an event applies only when its
//!     `sequence` exceeds `users.last_lifecycle_sequence`, so a redelivery is a no-op and a
//!     stale REINSTATED can't un-freeze a user a later SUSPENDED already froze;
//!   - the global `bridge_cursor.position` advances to the batch's `next_position` ONLY
//!     after every event in the batch is applied, so a crash mid-batch re-pulls and the
//!     per-user guard absorbs the re-apply.
//!
//! Not everything that crosses is a state machine. `frozen`, `kyc_level`, `role` and the
//! revoke floor each have a kind of their own and are ordered by `sequence`; the EMAIL has
//! neither. Concierge's `change_email` deliberately emits no event, on the contract that the
//! profile snapshot riding on the NEXT lifecycle row carries the change — so the snapshot is
//! applied here on every pulled event, whatever its kind, and never in a per-kind arm that a
//! new kind could forget to copy. A REPLAYED event is the exception: see [`Freshness`].
//!
//! Correlation is by `auth_subject` (the provider `sub` both planes provision against),
//! never concierge's own `user_id` — a CREATED event provisions a minimal local row for an
//! as-yet-unseen subject (banking otherwise materializes a user on first sign-in).
//!
//! NOTHING IS EVER CONSUMED WITHOUT BEING APPLIED. The cursor is a single global position
//! and the concierge never re-delivers behind it (`WHERE position > after_position`), so
//! every event that cannot be applied right now needs somewhere to go. There are exactly
//! two reasons an event cannot be applied, and they get opposite treatments because they
//! are unblocked by opposite things:
//!   - **The subject has no local row yet** — unblocked by that row appearing, which may
//!     be minutes away (first sign-in) or never (a CREATED that fell out of the outbox
//!     window before banking was deployed). Parked in `bridge_deferred_event` and replayed
//!     by [`BridgeConsumer::replay_deferred`] once the row exists; the cursor moves on, so
//!     one orphan subject cannot wedge the mirror for everyone else.
//!   - **The kind is one this build cannot name** — concierge ships ahead of banking, so a
//!     `Kind::Unspecified` is the ordinary shape of a mid-rollout event, and it is
//!     unblocked only by upgrading this binary. Nothing local can replay it, so the cursor
//!     STOPS on it (head-of-line) and the event stays in concierge's outbox at full
//!     fidelity until a build that understands it pulls it. Marking it applied instead is
//!     how a tier downgrade or a freeze could be swallowed while the money plane keeps
//!     running under rules the identity plane already revoked.
//!
//! What the channel proves about the peer — TLS, the pinned CA, the name the certificate
//! must carry, the optional client identity — is built in [`endpoint`], once, for this
//! consumer and the governance-mail relay alike.

/// and no coordinated rollout.
///
/// Two guards, both fail-closed:
///   - the value must PARSE as an `Email`. `users.email` is NOT NULL and every read
///     (`PgUsers::find_by_id`) parses it back, so an empty or malformed snapshot from an
///     older concierge would turn a loadable row into one whose profile and money surfaces
///     error out. A bad snapshot is dropped with a warning instead — the mirror keeps the
///     last address it trusted.
///   - the write is skipped when nothing differs, so the ordinary event (a freeze, a tier
///     move) does not churn `updated_at` for an address that never changed. `Email::parse`
///     normalizes exactly as `PgUsers::provision` does, so the two writers of this column
