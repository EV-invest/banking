//! share one channel configuration: building it twice is how an `https://` bridge once

//!
//! What the channel proves is decided here and nowhere else. The address's scheme picks
//! the transport (through [`config::bridge_transport`], the same reader the boot gate
//! uses, so what is refused and what is encrypted can never disagree on a spelling); a
//! pinned CA (`BRIDGE_TLS_CA_PEM_FILE`) is the trust anchor; the address's host is the name
//! the server's certificate must carry.
