//! Infrastructure: driven adapters over the concrete external systems the hub
//! runs on.
//!
//! - [`db`] — Postgres **control plane**: pool and migrations.
//! - [`tigerbeetle`] — the connected TigerBeetle client.
//! - [`ledger`] — the **data plane** `Ledger` [`Gateway`](domain::architecture::Gateway)
//!   over TigerBeetle (the chart of accounts, transfers, two-phase saga ops).
//! - [`users`] — Postgres repository for the `User` aggregate;
//!   [`subscriptions`] / [`redemptions`] / [`withdrawals`] — repositories for the
//!   money-plane aggregates (atomic state + drained events).
//! - [`outbox`] — the transactional outbox written inside the same transaction as
//!   the state change, plus its drain side.
//! - [`relay`] — the single-worker saga dispatcher that drains the outbox and
//!   issues TigerBeetle transfers (Write-Last), idempotently.
//! - [`reconciliation`] — the periodic PG-vs-TB discrepancy scan (cash invariant,
//!   clearing vs in-flight withdrawals, parked-row surface); alert-only, TB wins.
//! - [`reaper`] — the abandoned-saga sweep: alerts on stuck `processing` withdrawals
//!   and auto-resolves the safe `queued` redemptions/withdrawals past a max age.
//! - [`dispatcher`] — the treasury worker: re-checks `queued` withdrawals against both
//!   liquidity gates (TB rail + on-chain treasury) and dispatches the covered ones.
//! - [`fees`] — Postgres adapters for the fee plane (policy, accrual clocks, the
//!   charge, the bulk settlement of accumulated fee units).
//! - [`fee_accrual`] — the obligation the fee plane places on everyone who moves a cost
//!   basis: settle what the old basis accrued before writing the new one.
//! - [`fee_sweeper`] — the periodic worker that assesses management + performance fees
//!   against every unit-holding position that is due.
//! - [`operation_feed`] — the read-side merge of the four money projections into one
//!   time-ordered activity timeline (query side only; writes nothing).
//! - [`telemetry`] — the observability adapter: the one seam that hands errors to
//!   the monitoring vendor, so call sites stay vendor-agnostic.
//! - [`rails`] — what the EVM/TON/Tron rails share verbatim: the watcher and sweep error
//!   taxonomies, the wall clock, and the sweep's Postgres/signer plumbing parameterised by
//!   network. Per-protocol RPC, node error wording and log prefixes stay in the rail modules.
