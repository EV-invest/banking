//! Infrastructure: driven adapters over the concrete external systems the hub
//! runs on.
//!
//! - [`db`] — Postgres **control plane**: pool and migrations.
//! - [`tigerbeetle`] — the connected TigerBeetle client.
//! - [`ledger`] — the **data plane** `Ledger` [`Gateway`](domain::architecture::Gateway)
//!   over TigerBeetle (the chart of accounts, transfers, two-phase saga ops).
//! - [`users`] — Postgres repository for the `User` aggregate;
//!   [`subscriptions`] / [`redemptions`] / [`withdrawals`] — repositories for the
//!   money-plane aggregates (atomic state + drained events).
//! - [`outbox`] — the transactional outbox written inside the same transaction as
//!   the state change, plus its drain side.
//! - [`relay`] — the single-worker saga dispatcher that drains the outbox and
//!   issues TigerBeetle transfers (Write-Last), idempotently.
//! - [`telemetry`] — the observability adapter: the one seam that hands errors to
//!   the monitoring vendor, so call sites stay vendor-agnostic.
