//! Withdrawal dispatcher — the treasury worker that drains the accept-and-queue
//! backlog. A withdrawal on a rail short of liquidity is accepted and left `queued`
//! (PATTERNS: never refused); until now only the admin `DispatchWithdrawal` RPC ever
//! re-dispatched one. This periodic job is the automatic path: each sweep re-checks
//! every `queued` withdrawal against **both** liquidity gates — the TigerBeetle rail
//! accounting balance AND the custody adapter's real on-chain treasury view — and
//! dispatches the ones both cover, so a rail top-up self-heals the queue within one
//! interval. The reaper's 24h auto-cancel of `queued` withdrawals remains the final
//! backstop (the de-facto rail top-up SLA).

	/// the relay settles, so a batch summing past the rail would otherwise pass each
	/// static check, dispatch in full, and mass-park at the custody backstop. What no
