//! On-chain deposit watcher — credits user balances from confirmed USDT transfers.
//!
//! A read-mostly background task (sibling to the [`bridge`](super::bridge) consumer): it
//! polls an EVM JSON-RPC for ERC-20 `Transfer` logs of the USDT contract whose `to` is
//! one of our users' **derived** deposit addresses, waits `confirmations` blocks (reorg
//! safety), and records each via [`record_deposit`](crate::application::balance::record_deposit)
//! — idempotent by the on-chain `tx_ref` (`txhash:logindex`), so a re-scan never double-
//! credits. The relay then posts `Dr wallet:<net> / Cr user-claim`; the watcher itself
//! never touches TigerBeetle, so money is still written last, in the relay.
//!
//! Resume is from `deposit_scan_cursor` (per network). On first run it starts at the
//! configured start block, else the current safe head (watch from now). Only blocks at or
//! below `latest − confirmations` are scanned, so shallow reorgs are absorbed; a reorg
//! deeper than `confirmations` is a known, out-of-scope residual (reconciliation territory).
//!
//! A provider that has **pruned** the history the cursor points at (shared nodes keep a
//! bounded window of logs) can never serve that window, so the live scan bisects for the
//! oldest block it still has, jumps the cursor there, and reports the skipped range as an
//! incident at `error!` — those deposits are NOT credited and must be reconciled by hand
//! (`RecordDeposit`). Skipping is the lesser evil: retrying the pruned window forever wedges
//! the rail and loses every deposit AFTER the gap too.
//!
//! USDT arriving at the rail's **treasury** hot wallet from outside is watched but never
//! credited (#245): the chain names the wallet, not the person, and every claim needs a
//! holder. It is reported at `error!` with a counter (`telemetry`) — and by the treasury
//! drift watch as a surplus until an operator attributes it with `SeedCapital`, which
//! books it as that person's deposit and their subscription into `fund`.
//!
//! Generic over the EVM rail — one instance per chain (BEP20, Polygon), keyed by
//! `config.network`; the raw log value is scaled into canonical base units via
//! [`Usdt::from_onchain`], so a 6-dp rail (Polygon) and an 18-dp rail (BEP20) credit correctly.
//! The `eth_getLogs` `to`-topic filter (an OR over the watched addresses) means the endpoint
//! MUST support `eth_getLogs` — some public nodes don't; point the rail's RPC URL at one that does.
