//! Per-rail custody drift watch — does the ledger still describe the chain?
//!
//! [`reconciliation`](super::reconciliation) asserts the **global** `sum(custody) == sum(claims)`,
//! which is an identity between two TigerBeetle accounts: it holds whether or not the chain
//! agrees with either of them. Comparing a rail's `wallet:<net>` against the wallets it claims
//! to describe was left out as "the treasury's job, surfaced separately" — this is that surface.
//!
//! The gap it closes is real and was reached in production: USDT sent straight to a treasury
//! hot wallet moves money the ledger never records, and every existing check stays green,
//! because the invariant relates TB to TB. The rail's own screen showed the two numbers side by
//! side and nothing compared them.
//!
//! **Alert-only, never a write.** The house rule for reconciliation, and doubly right here: a
//! chain read can be stale, throttled or reorged, and a job that "corrected" the ledger from one
//! would post money on the strength of a flaky node. The credit path is the deposit watcher,
//! which is idempotent per transaction; this only says the two sides disagree.
//!
//! **The comparison.** `wallet:<net>` counts every USDT we control on the rail, wherever it sits
//! — the sweep moving funds from a deposit address to the treasury is invisible to it. So the
//! chain side must be the same union:
//!
//! ```text
//! expected = wallet:<net>                                    (TigerBeetle)
//! actual   = treasury balance + Σ derived deposit addresses   (chain)
//! ```
//!
//! `actual > expected` is unrecorded money arriving — the operator top-up above, or a user
//! sending to the wrong address. `actual < expected` is the serious direction: the ledger
//! believes in funds the chain cannot show, so it is reported at a louder level.
//!
//! **Races are not alerts.** Both sides are read at slightly different instants, so a transfer
//! landing between them shows up as drift that is gone a moment later. A divergence is only
//! reported once it has survived two consecutive scans with the same sign, which costs an
//! interval of latency on a real problem and removes the entire class of false alarm.
//!
//! **Gas is watched too**, and is a wholly separate failure: a rail can hold exactly the USDT
//! it should and still be unable to move any of it. Nothing else looks at the native balance —
//! `ensure_treasury_funded` parks the withdrawal at broadcast time, and parking is a hard stop
//! needing an operator, so without this the first symptom of an empty treasury is a user's
//! withdrawal breaking. Measured in withdrawals rather than coins (see
//! [`Custody::treasury_gas_runway`]) so one threshold means the same thing on every rail.
