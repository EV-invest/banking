//! Postgres adapter for the [`OperationFeed`] port — the caller's activity timeline.
//!
//! One `UNION ALL` over the four projections the write side already maintains
//! (`deposits`, `withdrawals`, `subscriptions`, `redemptions`), ordered and paged in
//! the database. Doing the merge here rather than in four round-trips is the whole
//! point of the port: `LIMIT` applies to the *merged* stream, so a user with a long
//! deposit history still sees their most recent redemption.
//!
//! A plain pool read — a projection, never a fact write, so no transaction. The rows
//! are read across aggregates but each is a self-consistent snapshot of its own row;
//! the timeline makes no cross-row invariant claim, so it needs no snapshot isolation.
//!
//! `party_id` on `deposits` is TEXT (the party may be a service, not a user) while the
//! other three key on a UUID `user_id` — hence the two bindings of the same caller.
