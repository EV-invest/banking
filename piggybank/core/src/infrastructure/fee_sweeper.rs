//! Fee sweeper — the worker that actually charges "2 and 20".
//!
//! Management fees accrue with the clock, so somebody has to wake up and collect them.
//! This is that somebody: every [`SWEEP_INTERVAL`] it takes the positions whose
//! management fee has not been accrued for at least [`MIN_ACCRUAL_AGE`] and assesses
//! each one. The performance leg rides along and crystallizes only when its own period
//! has elapsed, so a fund on annual crystallization is charged its 20% once a year even
//! though the sweeper visited the position daily.
//!
//! ## Why a minimum age, and why a batch cap
//!
//! Charging on every tick would be correct but wasteful — each charge is a Postgres
//! transaction plus a TigerBeetle transfer, and a fee accrued over a minute is
//! sub-base-unit dust that floors to nothing anyway. [`MIN_ACCRUAL_AGE`] makes the
//! cadence daily; the accrual itself is exact regardless, because it is a function of
//! elapsed seconds and not of how often this job runs. Miss a week and the next sweep
//! bills that week — no drift, no double-charge.
//!
//! The per-cycle [`BATCH`] cap bounds the work one pass can do so a fund with a hundred
//! thousand holders cannot monopolise the pool; the ordering (`oldest accrual first`)
//! makes the backlog drain fairly rather than starving whoever sorts last.
//!
//! ## What it will not do
//!
//! A per-position failure warns and moves on: one investor whose fund has a stale NAV
//! must not stop every other investor's fee from being collected. And a fee is never
//! forced — if the holder's units are locked or escrowed, the charge is recorded and
//! carried as debt rather than drawn from units the holder cannot spare; only a charge
//! that is not owed at all (it floors to nothing) persists nothing, and then the accrual
//! simply continues (see [`domain::fees::FeeCharge::is_empty`]).
//!
//! ## The second clock: promoting a change of terms
//!
//! A scheduled [`FeePolicyChange`](crate::ports::fees::FeePolicyChange) becomes the live
//! policy at its `effective_from`, and that moment needs a worker to notice it. It rides
//! this task on a tighter cadence ([`PROMOTION_INTERVAL`]) than the hourly charge: a minute
//! late is invisible against a 24h notice, an hour late is a holder charged the old rate
//! for an hour longer than they were told.
