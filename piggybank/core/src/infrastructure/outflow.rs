//! Postgres adapter for the [`OutflowPolicy`] port — the control-plane facts every
//! payout path clears before money leaves.
//!
//! It owns a pool clone (an `Arc` under the hood) rather than a borrow, so one instance can
//! sit in [`AppState`](crate::AppState) beside the other adapters and be lent to the
//! withdrawal, payment and consilium use cases alike — the pause is one fact, read through
//! one handle, and a use case that could not borrow it would have to be trusted to remember
//! it. It is built INSIDE `AppState::new` from the pool already passed there rather than
//! threaded through as a twenty-sixth constructor argument.
