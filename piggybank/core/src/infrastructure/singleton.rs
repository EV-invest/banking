//! Session-scoped `pg_advisory_lock` — the "exactly one of me is running" primitive.
//!
//! The outbox relay has held one of these since it was written, because multi-replica is an
//! anticipated shape of this deployment rather than a hypothetical: a second replica draining
//! the same queue is not a slowdown, it is two workers racing the same rows. The governance
//! workers drain shared queues too and had no such guard, so this lifts the relay's pattern
//! into one place both can use.
//!
//! The lock's lifetime IS the returned connection's lifetime. Postgres releases a
//! session-level advisory lock when the session ends, so a crashed or reaped holder frees it
//! for a standby with no lease to expire and no tombstone to clean up. Dropping the
//! connection returns it to the pool still holding the lock — which is why the callers here
//! `close()` rather than drop when they mean to release it.
