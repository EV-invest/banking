//! Liveness (`Check`) and readiness (`Readiness`) probes for the gRPC surface.
//!
//! `Check` is trivial and unauthenticated — "is the process up?" — and backs the
//! `cabinet` BFF smoke path (browser → BFF → gRPC). `Readiness` answers the distinct
//! question "can this instance actually move money?": it pings Postgres and TigerBeetle
//! and inspects the outbox, so an orchestrator/LB drains an instance that is up but
//! wedged (dead DB, unreachable ledger, parked rows, or a growing dispatch backlog)
//! instead of routing money-moving traffic to it. Both stay unauthenticated — they are
//! infrastructure probes, not data services (see [`services::serve`](super)).
