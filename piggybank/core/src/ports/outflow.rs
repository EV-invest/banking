//! The outflow-policy port — the control-plane facts that decide whether money may

//!
//! A **query-side** port: it reports facts and decides nothing. The policy that reads
//! them lives in [`application::withdrawals`](crate::application::withdrawals), so the
//! dispatcher sweep, the admin `DispatchWithdrawal` RPC and any future payout path share
//! one rule instead of one copy each — which is exactly how the KYC floor came to be
//! enforced at withdrawal *admission* and nowhere near the point where the money actually
//! leaves.
//!
//! Both facts are read-side only; nothing here writes. The freeze flag and the mirrored
//! KYC tier come back together ([`PayoutStanding`]) because they are columns of the same
//! row and every caller wants both — two round trips would buy nothing but a window in
//! which they disagree.
