//! Persistence + read port for the [`Subscription`] aggregate.
//!
//! A subscription is an immutable mint record, so the write side is a single `open`
//! (no state transitions). `open` takes the shared per-user claim lock, writes the
//! subscription row, and drains its `Subscribed` event — all in one transaction. The
//! relay then posts the cash move + unit mint (Write-Last) and, only after the cash leg
//! lands, the `fund_positions` cost-basis projection — so a parked cash leg can never
//! strand a phantom basis.
