//! The deposit-address port — a user's per-network address to receive USDT at.
//!
//! On account-model chains (BEP20/TRC20) a per-user deposit address is the only way
//! to attribute an incoming transfer — a USDT transfer carries no memo — so addresses
//! are HD-derived from the fund's xpub. This port hands the application a **stable**
//! address per (user, network); a stub deterministically derives and caches one until
//! the real key-management/derivation service exists.
