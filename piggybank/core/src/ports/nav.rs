//! The fund-valuation (NAV) port — the operator-posted AUM marks a fund's NAV is
//! derived from.
//!
//! NAV per share = `AUM / units_outstanding`, derived at post time and frozen until the
//! next mark. This port stores the append-only marks and returns the latest (the
//! "current" price subscribe/redeem deal on). Plain control-plane reads/writes — a
//! valuation is not an aggregate, so no `Repository` marker (and no "Repository" in
//! the name, which the kernel reserves for aggregate persistence).
