//! The TigerBeetle ledger gateway port.
//!
//! [`Ledger`] is a [`Gateway`] — the anti-corruption boundary to an external
//! transactional system that owns its own atomicity. The kernel gives `Gateway` no
//! `UnitOfWork` accessor, so "the ledger cannot join a Postgres transaction" is a
//! compile-discoverable fact: money is written **last**, in the relay, after the
//! control-plane commit.
//!
//! The port speaks the domain chart of accounts ([`LedgerAccountKey`],
//! [`TransferCode`]); the adapter resolves keys to `u128` TigerBeetle ids (via the
//! `tb_accounts` map) and creates accounts with the correct non-negative flag on
//! first touch. Transfer `id`s are **caller-assigned and deterministic** (derived
//! from the event id), so a retried submit returns `Exists` — idempotent by design.
//! Amounts are always **explicit** (never TB balancing flags), so a retry moves the
//! exact amount frozen into the event.
