//! Persistence ports for the fee plane — policy, per-investor accrual state, the
//! charge, and the periodic conversion of accumulated fee units into cash.
//!
//! Three seams, deliberately separate:
//!
//! - [`FeePolicies`] is plain control-plane configuration keyed by `service` — terms,
//!   not money. A service with no row charges nothing.
//! - [`PositionAccruals`] is the read side of the accrual clocks living on the
//!   `fund_positions` projection. It deliberately does **not** return a unit balance:
//!   units are authoritative in TigerBeetle, and a fee capped by a projection that lags
//!   the ledger would be a fee capped by the wrong number. The application joins this
//!   with a live TB read.
//! - [`FeeAssessments`] writes a charge. Its one method is atomic across three things
//!   that must never drift apart — the audit row, the position's new debt/mark/clocks,
//!   and the outbox event the relay turns into the unit clawback.
