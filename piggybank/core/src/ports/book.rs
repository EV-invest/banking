//! Persistence + read port for the allocation book — orders, trades, the per-product
//! policy and the revision counter the live feed is keyed on.
//!
//! One port rather than a repository per aggregate, because the book's write is not a
//! transition on one aggregate: a placement touches the incoming order, every resting
//! order it hits and a trade between each pair, and the whole set has to commit under
//! the book's single write lock or not at all. [`BookStore::place`] is that transaction.
//! It takes the [`MatchingEngine`] as a parameter — the engine is pure and the adapter
//! merely runs it under the lock and records what it decided — so the matching rule can
//! change without the persistence changing with it.
//!
//! The escrow an order commits and the settlement of a fill are NOT written here: they
//! are [`BookEvent`](domain::book::BookEvent)s drained to the outbox inside the same
//! transaction, and the relay moves the money afterwards (Write-Last), exactly as a
//! subscription's cash and mint follow its row. So an order is on the book the moment
//! its row commits, and the balances a client reads catch up at the relay's latency.
