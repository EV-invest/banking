//! Persistence + read ports for the [`PaymentOrder`] aggregate.
//!
//! Every method is internally atomic and the method IS the transaction boundary — no caller
//! ever holds one across the port. Two of them carry the weight:
//!
//! - [`PaymentRepository::open`] writes the order, its materialized approval requirement
//!   (a consent seat, or the link to the consilium that will decide it) and the drained
//!   events in ONE transaction, so an order can never exist with no record of what would
//!   authorize it;
//! - [`PaymentRepository::submit`] counts the attempt, compares the code, records the
//!   decision and transitions the order **all under one `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the
//!   `payments` row** — not on the consent row, because the order is what the transition
//!   belongs to and locking the seat instead would let the approval and the order move in
//!   two transactions a retry could interleave.
//!
//! **TigerBeetle is never touched here.** A payment's money moves in the relay, from the
//! `Reserved`/`Settled` events these methods drain to the outbox — the one ACID point stays
//! Postgres, exactly as it does for every other money aggregate.
