//! Integration test for the withdrawal double-broadcast race — the over-withdrawal
//! exploit. Real Postgres **and** TigerBeetle (no mocks, per the project rules); runs
//! when `DATABASE_URL` is set and a TigerBeetle replica is reachable, skips otherwise.
//!
//! The race: `request_withdrawal`'s Read-First reads TigerBeetle, which lags
//! committed-but-undrained outbox rows — so a double-submit of the full balance passes
//! the solvency check twice and commits two Requested(+Dispatched) pairs. The relay
//! then parks the second reserve (`InsufficientFunds`), but without a guard the
//! trailing Dispatched row still reaches custody: the Broadcast op has no TB leg to
//! refuse it, and real money leaves the chain with nothing locked behind it.
//!
//! What's proven: the relay refuses to broadcast a withdrawal whose clearing
//! reservation never applied (the `saga_steps` Read-First in `Relay::dispatch`) —
//! custody sees exactly one broadcast, the second withdrawal's rows are parked (not
//! dispatched), and the user's claim is never over-spent.
