//! The hub's funds gate on the phase-4 custody migration — real Postgres + a real in-process
//! signer gRPC server (no DB mocks). Runs when `DATABASE_URL` is set and skips otherwise; each
//! test uses a fresh `user_id`, so runs are isolated on shared infra.
//!
//! Balances live on the chain and the signer has no chain view, so the "is anything still on
//! that address" question can only be answered here — and this is the test that it IS asked,
//! before anything is retired. The predicate is the sweeper's own (`deposits.swept_at IS
//! NULL`): while a credited deposit has not been observed drained, the address may still hold
//! money and must not be retired.
//!
//! Two properties, both about the value travelling rather than the call succeeding:
//!
//!   * an unswept credited deposit blocks the migration, and the signer is never called;
//!   * once swept, the migration runs, the hub caches the NEW address (so watchers and
//!     `GetDepositAddress` stop pointing at the retired one), and the address handed to the
//!     signer is the very address the gate cleared.
