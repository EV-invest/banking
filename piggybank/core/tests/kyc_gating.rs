//! KYC enforcement — the money plane refusing an unverified investor. Real Postgres
//! **and** TigerBeetle (no mocks, per the project rules); runs when `DATABASE_URL` is set
//! and a replica is reachable (`nix run .#db` + `.#tb`), skips otherwise. Each test uses a
//! fresh provisioned user, so runs are isolated on shared infrastructure.
//!
//! `kyc_level` is the concierge tier mirrored onto the local `users` row by the lifecycle
//! bridge; banking never authors it, so these tests set the column the way the bridge
//! does. Tier 0 is what `provision` leaves behind — a registration and a confirmed email,
//! nothing verified.
//!
//! What's proven:
//!
//! - tier 0 gets **no deposit address**, and the address gateway is never reached — the
//!   gate sits above the port precisely because the first call there mints a signer
//!   keypair, and a key issued to an unverified user is an address the fund must watch,
//!   sweep and account for forever;
//! - tier 0 **cannot withdraw**, with a funded claim, so the refusal is the gate and not
//!   insolvency;
//! - tier 1 does both;
//! - the refusals are told apart at the wire: an unconfigured rail is `Ok(None)` ("this
//!   rail cannot fund you"), an unverified caller is `Forbidden` ("finish verification");
//! - a **payment out of the fee allocation is not gated** — its source is the platform's
//!   own money, held by people through units, with no user behind it to verify; what
//!   gates it is the owners' quorum.
