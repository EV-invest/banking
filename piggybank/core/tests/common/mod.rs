//! Shared bring-up for the integration tests: real Postgres **and** TigerBeetle, no
//! mocks. Every suite here opens the same two connections the same way, so the steps
//! live once instead of once per file — including the one decision about a missing
//! service: skip locally, fail under CI (see [`skip_or_fail`]).
//!
//! Each test binary gets **its own database**, cloned from a migrated template (see
//! [`database_url`]). Two things forced that: the outbox relay's advisory lock is scoped to
//! a database, so binaries sharing one (two `cargo test --test …` side by side) raced for it
//! and timed out; and one shared database migrated by another branch's build failed every
//! suite with "migration N was previously applied but has been modified". The unit is the
//! binary, not the process: a runner that forks one process per *test* (nextest) would have
//! every process drop and re-create the same clone under its siblings — that needs a
//! per-process name and is not supported here.
//!
//! Each integration test is its own crate, so a suite that uses only part of this
//! module still compiles the rest — hence the blanket `dead_code` allowance.

/// advisory lock (`acquire_outbox_lock`) needs it because the lock is one per database, so a

/// out while `run` is still queued behind it. A test that only calls the unfenced
/// `Relay::drain` never touches that lock, but shares the table it drains, and two of a
/// binary's relays draining at once pick up the same row and both act on it. Two shapes have
/// been observed. The loser's `saga_steps` insert trips the table's second unique key
/// (`tb_transfer_id`), which its `ON CONFLICT (event_id, leg)` does not cover; the relay files
/// that as a transient failure and `drain()` returns early, leaving the calling test's own
/// rows queued, so it reads a balance the relay has not landed yet (#294/#298). And a row ends
/// up with `dispatched_at` *and* `parked_at` set, each written by a different custody fake —
/// the mechanism behind the `relay_recovery` flakes.
///
/// One lock for both, not one per reason: a mutex per reason serializes each class against
/// itself and neither against the other, so a `run` test and a `drain` test in one binary
/// would race over the same outbox with both guards held and nothing to show for it. Take it
/// once per test — `tokio::sync::Mutex` is not reentrant.
///

/// so another binary — even one running at the same time — can never reach them. What remains
