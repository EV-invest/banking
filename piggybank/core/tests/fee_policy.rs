//! Integration tests for the fee plane — real Postgres **and** TigerBeetle (no mocks,
//! per the project rules). They run when `DATABASE_URL` is set and a TigerBeetle replica
//! is reachable (e.g. `nix run .#db` + `.#tb`), and skip otherwise.
//!
//! What these pin down is the *shape* of the charge, not just its arithmetic (the maths
//! is covered by `domain::fees`' unit tests). Three properties are the whole design and
//! each has a test that would fail loudly if it regressed:
//!
//! 1. **A fee moves units, never cash.** The investor's USDT claim and the fund's claim
//!    are untouched by a charge — which is why collecting one costs no chain fee and can
//!    never drive a balance negative.
//! 2. **Units outstanding do not change.** A charge is a transfer between two holders, so
//!    NAV per unit does not move and no other investor pays for it.
//! 3. **The mark is per investor.** Two holders in the same fund at the same NAV owe
//!    different fees when they entered at different prices.
//!
//! Clocks are moved by backdating the position's accrual columns rather than by waiting,
//! so "a year of holding" is a single SQL statement.
