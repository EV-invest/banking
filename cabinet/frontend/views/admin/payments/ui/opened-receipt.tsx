// What just happened, said accurately.
//
// The operator has clicked a button on a money surface, and the natural reading of any
// receipt is "it is done". This one leads with OPENED, says in plain words that nothing
// has moved, and names who has been asked — because that is the plane's answer, not the
// form's preview: an owner consilium (with the room linked, where the live tally is) or
// one investor's mailbox. It offers no "view payment" affordance beyond the list below,
// because until someone answers there is nothing more to see.
