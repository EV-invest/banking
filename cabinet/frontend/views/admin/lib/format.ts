 * WHY an account is blocked, and therefore which control the console may offer.

 *
 *   · `"admin_hold"`  — one operator's brake. It lapses by itself at `hold_expires_at`,
 *                       and a single `reinstateUser` lifts it.
 *   · `"governance"`  — the owners' ratified verdict. It never lapses, and the one-act
 *                       route REFUSES it: lifting it is `openUserReinstatement`. Offering
 *                       the button anyway would be the `FAILED_PRECONDITION` complaint
 *                       again, on the surface where it matters most.
 *   · `""`            — empty on an ACTIVE user, and ALSO on one suspended before the field
 *                       existed. Those carry the semantics they were actually suspended
 *                       under: one act to lift, and no lapse. So an empty string is not a
 *                       synonym for active — it has to be read together with `status`, and
 *                       a blocked account with no recorded provenance is its own case.
 *
 * Returning a union rather than booleans is what stops a caller reconstructing the same
 * mistake: there is no `isHeld` to compare against, only a `kind` the compiler makes them
 * handle. `expiresAt` exists on exactly the one case that has a deadline, so no screen can
 * render a lapse time for a suspension that never lapses.
