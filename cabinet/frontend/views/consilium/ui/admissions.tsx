// Open owner admissions: what each one says, where the caller stands in it, and the form
// that opens a new one.
//
// The sibling of `./removals.tsx`, and read alongside it — the layout, the branches and the
// zero states are deliberately the same shape, because these are the two halves of one
// question and an owner should not have to relearn the screen halfway down it. What is NOT
// the same is the rule and the words, and both differences are load-bearing:
//
//   · **The rule is stricter.** A removal has two paths — the target accepts, or the
//     eligible peers are unanimous. An admission has one: unanimity of every owner except
//     the initiator, with at least one such peer. A reader who has just learned the removal
//     rule will assume a majority is enough here, so the copy says otherwise in the tally
//     line itself rather than in a footnote.
//   · **The verbs are different.** `admit`/`reject`, never `remove`/`keep`. The plane keeps
//     two enums for this, and the one word they share means opposite things — `reject`
//     keeps an owner on a removal and refuses a candidate here. Nothing in this file is
//     shared with the removal controls; the two vote buttons post through
//     `voteOnAdmission`, whose parameter type accepts neither of the other plane's words.
//
// Why admission is governed at all, if a reader wonders: `SetRole` granting `owner` freely
// would let a bad actor mint sock puppets before opening a payout and then reach quorum
// legitimately, which would make every other control in this feature decorative
// (docs/CONSILIUM.md, policy 21).

 *   · It does not re-derive the server's refusals. The plane owns "may this open?" — the
 *     genesis window, the peer set, whether the candidate is already seated — and a client
 *     that re-computes those is a client that can disagree, in the direction of blocking a
 *     legitimate action. The rules are stated; the button stays live; the server's own
 *     refusal is what appears.
 *   · It does not offer a picker, and the raw id field is the considered answer rather
 *     than an unfinished one. A candidate is by definition not an owner, so the roster
 *     cannot list them; the only read that enumerates non-owners is the operator console's
 *     `/api/admin/users`, which is gated on operator/admin. An owner who is not also an
 *     operator — the ordinary case, and exactly the person this form exists for — is
 *     refused it. A searchable dropdown would therefore be empty or forbidden for half the
 *     people entitled to use this form, and swapping a field that always works for a
 *     control that sometimes does is not an improvement. Closing this properly needs an
 *     owner-readable candidate lookup on the plane, which is a contract change, not a
 *     component change. Until then the field takes the id and the description says where
 *     to find it.
