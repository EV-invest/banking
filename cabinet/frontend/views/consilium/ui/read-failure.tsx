// What a card on this page shows when the read behind it did not arrive.
//
// Three things it is not, each of which this page shipped:
//
//   · Not nothing. A title and a description above an empty box is the state the reader
//     cannot act on and cannot even name — every card here shows a skeleton, a designed
//     zero state, or this.
//   · Not "Not found." A raw status turned into prose tells an owner what an HTTP client
//     saw, never what it means for them. What it means is that the page cannot show who
//     owns the fund or what is being decided, and that is what these read.
//   · Not a bare grey sentence in a blank box (AGENTS.md § Frontend design rules). It is
//     uikit's `Empty`, like every other zero state in the cabinet, and it carries the one
//     action that can change the situation.
//
// **No motion, deliberately.** `ResourceError` — what these cards used before — renders a
// `StaggerItem`, which carries no `initial`/`animate` of its own and takes both from the
// `Stagger` above it. That is right for a section present when the page arrives, and it is
// a bet for one that mounts afterwards: a failure appears, by definition, once the sequence
// it would have joined has finished, so its visibility depends on the variant tree being
// re-run rather than on anything this component does. A message saying the reader cannot
// trust what is on screen is not the place to take that bet. The sections of this page
// still arrive through `Stagger` — this is a child of one, not one of them.
