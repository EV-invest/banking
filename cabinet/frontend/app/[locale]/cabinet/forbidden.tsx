// Next's `forbidden.tsx` file convention (experimental `authInterrupts`, enabled in
// next.config.ts): rendered with a 403 whenever the `forbidden()` interrupt is
// invoked from a Server Component or Route Handler. It is NOT a browsable
// `/forbidden` route.
//
// The flag matters — without it next-app-loader never resolves this file and the
// page is silently ignored, which is how it sat here doing nothing until now.
//
// The admin console's own gate is client-side (the principal is read from the
// shell's `/api/auth/session` in the browser), so it renders the 403 surface
// directly instead of calling this — see `(app)/admin/layout.tsx`. This file backs
// the server half: anything that learns "signed in, but not allowed" while
// rendering on the server.
