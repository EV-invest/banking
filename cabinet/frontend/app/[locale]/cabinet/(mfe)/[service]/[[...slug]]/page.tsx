// not a developer aside: it used to render a soft-200 "Unknown microfrontend —
// add it to mfe-registry.json" panel, which the conductor proxies straight onto
// the public origin. `notFound()` instead, so the reader gets the branded 404 in
// their own language and crawlers and monitoring get the status code to match.
