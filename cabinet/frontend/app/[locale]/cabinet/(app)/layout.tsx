// The authenticated app shell: a fixed left rail beside a scrollable content
// column. Chromeless by design — the brand header is conductor-owned and
// injected at the zone mount (the cabinet knows nothing about the outer site;
// `--ev-shell-offset` is the only shell contract). The rail is `fixed` (see
// Sidebar), so the content column reserves its width with a matching left
// padding — both read the shared `--cabinet-rail-w` token. No footer here by
// design. Auth is enforced upstream in `proxy.ts` — unauthenticated requests
// are redirected to /login before this layout renders; SessionKeeper mounts
// once here to keep the short-TTL access cookie alive for as long as this shell
// is open (that cookie, not the one the proxy gates on, is what the BFF
// verifies). The system banner
// (maintenance · read-only · announcement) mounts once here; (auth) pages have
// no session, so they are intentionally excluded.
//
// Responsive: below 1024px the sidebar is replaced by a fixed bottom nav bar
// (BottomNavbar). The content column goes full-width with no left offset and
// reserves room for the bottom nav so no content is occluded.
//
// The rail lists the fund catalogue. It is read here, on the server, under its own boundary so
// a slow BFF never holds the shell: the fallback is the rail told a seed is coming
// (`catalog={null}`), so it does not make the browser read the seed makes unnecessary — the
// root hydrates before this boundary does. A failed read is no seed, and the rail reads as
// it always did.
//
// Screens show times in the reader's own zone; the provider tells them which zone the
// server rendered in, so hydration reproduces it (`shared/lib/time-zone.tsx`).
