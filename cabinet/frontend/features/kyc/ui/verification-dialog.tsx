// this is a thing the reader stops to read, not a panel they work alongside.

// It is controlled rather than carrying its own trigger: the banner's trigger is a whole card,
// the profile's is a row button, and the wallet's is a link inside a rail — one `DialogTrigger`
// could not be all three. Being controlled is also why it is mounted beside each trigger and
// stays mounted while closed, which is what `reset` below is for.
