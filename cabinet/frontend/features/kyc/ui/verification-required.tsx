/**
 * What stands where a money surface would be for a caller the hub has not cleared yet.
 *
 * Not a failure box. The hub refuses a deposit address and a withdrawal below tier 1 on
 * purpose, and it says so distinctly — but the deposit screen flattened that into "deposit
 * address unavailable" over "this rail is still being provisioned", on every rail at once.
 * That reads as an outage the reader can only wait out, for a state they can leave in one
 * click. Withdraw had the mirror of it: a form that filled in completely and refused on
 * submit.
 *
 * Title and description are the caller's because what is closed differs between the screens;
 * the way out is identical, so it lives here — and it is the SAME dialog the profile card and
 * Home's checklist open (#213/#215/#382), so the account of what verification involves is
 * written once rather than three times.
 *
 * Parity with those two is not only the dialog, though: it is also the question of whether a
 * start may be offered AT ALL. A caller with a running case that cannot be resumed holds the
 * start gate on the plane, so the button here could only fail — the wrong-cause refusal #215
 * exists to remove, arrived at from a different direction. `useKycStatus` answers that for
 * all three surfaces; this block is the one that serves the money screens, which is where the
 * doomed click costs a paid vendor session.
