// Where a user begins — or picks up — identity verification from their profile. It sits inside
// `card-Verification`, below the rows that state what the hub currently holds, so the card
// reads as status-then-action rather than as a form.
//
// Four states, because the tier alone was never enough to tell them apart (#190):
//
//   · nothing read yet — a skeleton, like the two rows above it. `/kyc/status` is its own
//     resource with no persisted value, so it starts reading when THIS row mounts, which is
//     already after the profile landed: the window is real, and guessing through it renders
//     the live Start button at exactly the user this row exists to stop — the one who just
//     came back from the vendor;
//   · nothing running — the invitation;
//   · a running case the user can re-enter — the same action, worded as a continuation. A
//     repeat start returns the SAME vendor session (concierge#55), so this costs nothing;
//   · a running case with nowhere to return to — no button, because it could only fail. What
//     stands in its place is a pending Pill and a way to reach a person: a waiting state that
//     is a grey sentence and an empty slot tells the reader neither what is happening nor
//     what they may still do.
//
// The button opens the dialog rather than starting: what the user is about to hand over, and
// how long it takes, is said once and in one place (#213) — this row is the entry, not the
// explanation.
