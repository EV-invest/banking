/**
 * What the shell's verification chip says, decided once and away from React.
 *
 * Four states, ordered by what the reader can do about them. The tier is the verdict the hub
 * acts on, so it outranks every case: a verified caller is verified whatever a stale case row
 * says. Below the entry tier the running case decides — and one of its statuses is not a wait
 * but a request: `resubmitted` means a reviewer sent specific steps back (concierge migration
 * 0010), so the reader is the one holding it up, and the chip has to say so. A decided case
 * — approved, declined, expired — never reaches the browser: the plane drops it from
 * `/kyc/status` the moment it resolves (`../api/kyc-contract`), so a declined attempt looks
 * exactly like no attempt, and the chip offers a start again rather than inventing a verdict
 * it cannot read.
 *
 * `null` when nothing could be read: `useKycStatus` answers `loading: false, level: 0` once
 * BOTH reads have failed, and a chip that took that for tier 0 would call a verified reader
 * "Not verified" over a network blip — the same rule `../lib/money-gate` applies.
 *
 * Pure, so `node --test` can run it: the cabinet has no component tests.
