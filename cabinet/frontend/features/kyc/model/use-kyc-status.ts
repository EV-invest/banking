// One answer to "what may this screen offer?", shared by the profile card, the home banner
// and the wallet, so none of them has to compose a tier and a case for itself.
//
// Two sources, in a fixed order of trust. `/kyc/status` is authoritative and fresh — it is
// the only thing that knows a case is running. The profile is the fallback, and stays the
// answer when the plane cannot be read at all: a cabinet deployed ahead of the concierge
// release that adds the route must behave exactly as it does today, offering a start on tier
// 0, rather than going blank or refusing one.
