// One answer to "what may this screen offer?", so no screen has to compose a tier and a case
// for itself.
//
// Its caller today is the profile card's start row, and that is the whole list: the banner
// (#213) and the money screens (#215) are the two PRs above this one in the stack, and until
// they land those surfaces still read the profile's mirrored tier alone. Said plainly here
// because the first draft of this comment promised all three, and a promise in a docblock
// reads as coverage — the money screens are exactly where offering a doomed start costs a
// paid vendor session.
//
// Two sources, in a fixed order of trust. `/kyc/status` is authoritative and fresh — it is
// the only thing that knows a case is running. The profile is the fallback, and stays the
// answer when the plane cannot be read at all: a cabinet deployed ahead of the concierge
// release that adds the route must behave exactly as it does today, offering a start on tier
// 0, rather than going blank or refusing one.
