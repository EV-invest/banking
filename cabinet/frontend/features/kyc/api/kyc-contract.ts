// The wire contract of the identity plane's two KYC routes, as the browser sees it.
//
// `/kyc/start` and `/kyc/status` are not in `contracts/openapi.json` — they are web-surface
// routes on concierge, not gRPC, so no generated type exists and none is coming. What the
// slice used to do instead was hand-probe each answer at the point of use: `readString(data,
// "redirect_url")` in one place, `readString(error.body, "contact")` in another. A rename on
// the plane's side turned into "please try again" in front of a healthy provider.
//
// So the shape is written down HERE, once, as narrowing functions. Their counterpart is the
// integration test in concierge (`runner/tests/kyc.rs`), which compares whole JSON documents
// against the same shapes — a rename fails there, and is refused here.
//
// No schema library: four shapes do not earn a dependency in `package.json`, and the probing
// they need is three lines each (see `../lib/read-field`).
//
// The status half has no reader on THIS branch and is not meant to: it is the contract the
// running-case gate is built on one PR up the stack (#190), which is where `KycStatus`,
// `KycCase` and `RUNNING_CASE_STATUSES` acquire their consumer. Pinned here, with the start
// half, because both routes are one release of the plane and drift on either is the same bug.

/**
 * The closed dictionary of `{ "error": … }` codes both routes WILL publish, once
 * concierge#76 (`fen/kyc-start-contract`) ships. Anything outside it is drift, and is read
 * as "no code at all" rather than guessed at.
 *
 * Against the concierge that is deployed today only `kyc_unavailable` is on the wire: every
 * other refusal is still plain text with no JSON body (`StartError::Plain`), and
 * `/kyc/status` does not exist at all. So the status-only fallback in `./start-outcome`
 * is not a legacy branch — it is the branch that fires, and it stays until #76 is released.
 *
 * `kyc_unavailable` is the only one carrying a second field (`contact`), and the only one
 * whose meaning is a designed state rather than a fault.
