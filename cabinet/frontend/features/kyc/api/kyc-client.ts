 * a thrown error would have the UI reconstructing the distinction from a status code.
 *
 * `stale` and `throttled` are here for the same reason and no other: neither has wording of
 * its own in the transport's table that fits — a 24-hour cap is not "give it a moment", and a
 * stale CSRF token is not "you don't have access to this". Everything that carries a code the
 * transport already words stays inside `failed` — this layer names outcomes, it does not
