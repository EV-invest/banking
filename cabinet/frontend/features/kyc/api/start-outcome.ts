// alias, which the test runner (`node --test --experimental-strip-types`) does not resolve,
// so anything living there is untestable by construction — and this is the only part of the
// slice whose behaviour a plane release can change under it. `shared/lib/consilium-refusal`

// It takes the status and the body rather than the `RequestError` that carries them, which
// is what keeps it importable: `instanceof RequestError` would drag the whole transport —
// and the session machinery under it — into a unit test that needs neither.
