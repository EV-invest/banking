// Product marks for the allocation catalog — which glyph a fund is drawn with, and which
// tint frames it. Three surfaces draw one (the rail's Products group, the invest card, the
// product page header) and they must agree: the same fund has to look like itself
// everywhere, which is the whole reason the icon is an operator-chosen attribute rather
// than something each screen derives.
//
// Its own module with no `shared/ui/icons/index.ts` barrel, for the same reason
// `./networks.tsx` has none: a barrel would let a future icon set ride along into every
// route that only wanted this one.
//
// The mapping lives here rather than as a field on `Allocation` or on `Product`: a
// component reference on the wire object would pull all ten glyphs into every module that
// merely names a fund, and `views/invest/lib/product.ts` is deliberately pure with no React
// in it. `@/shared/contracts` stays a types-only module for the same reason.
//
// Bundle: the rail is a client component on every signed-in screen and lists every
// registered product, and any product may carry any of the ten icons — so there is no
// subset to split off, and the whole table legitimately belongs in the shared chunk.
// Loading it lazily would be actively wrong: `allocationsResource` is `persist: true`
// precisely so the rail paints its products on the first frame of a return visit, and a
// dynamically imported glyph would arrive a frame later and pop. What IS avoided is
// avoidable weight — named imports from `lucide-react` (which ships `sideEffects: false`
// ESM and sits in Next's default `optimizePackageImports`), so exactly ten glyph modules
// are pulled rather than the icon index.
