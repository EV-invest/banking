/**
 * A figure that travels to its new value instead of being replaced by it.
 *
 * On a balance this is the difference between "the number is 12,480" and "the
 * number *became* 12,480" — after a deposit settles or a poll lands, the motion
 * is the only thing that says which digits changed and in which direction.
 *
 * Three deliberate implementation choices:
 *
 * - **The DOM is written directly, not through React.** `animate()` drives a
 *   plain number and `onUpdate` writes the text. A 60fps count that went
 *   through `setState` would re-render this component ~40 times per second and,
 *   through it, everything the parent re-renders with it. Nothing here needs to
 *   be in the React tree, so it isn't. The write sets `nodeValue` on the text
 *   node already there rather than `textContent`, which would discard it and
 *   create a new one on every frame — the same in-place update React itself
 *   makes for a string child. `textContent` is only the fallback for a span
 *   with no text node to update.
 * - **`useLayoutEffect`, not `useEffect`.** The JSX renders the *final* string
 *   so that SSR, a crawler, or a JS failure all show the true figure. The layout
 *   effect overwrites it with the starting figure before the browser paints, so
 *   the correct-but-not-yet-animated value is never visible. In a plain effect
 *   that overwrite lands after a paint and the number visibly snaps back to the
 *   start before counting up.
 * - **The final figure never depends on an animation frame.** The count runs on
 *   `requestAnimationFrame`, which a hidden tab does not get; left to the
 *   animation alone, a page opened in the background reads "$0.00" until it is
 *   brought to the front (banking#346). `driveNumber` snaps to the final figure
 *   when the page is hidden at the start, when it goes hidden mid-count, or on a
 *   timer set just past the count's own duration — whichever comes first.
 *
 * Pair with `tabular-nums` at the call site. Proportional digits change width as
 * they cycle, and a figure that jitters sideways while it counts is worse than
 * one that simply appears.
