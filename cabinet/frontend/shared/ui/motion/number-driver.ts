// The frame-independent half of `AnimatedNumber`: decides *when* the final
// figure is written, so that it lands within a bounded time even if the count
// never gets an animation frame.
//
// Why this exists. The count is driven by `animate()` from motion, which advances
// on `requestAnimationFrame`. A hidden tab (a background window, a test harness
// with `document.visibilityState === "hidden"`) gets no frames, so the count never
// ticks past its starting figure and the tile reads "$0.00" for as long as the
// tab stays hidden — with the true value sitting in the API response the whole
// time (banking#346). Timers still fire in hidden tabs, throttled; frames do
// not. So the driver has three ways to reach the final figure and takes
// whichever comes first: the animation completing, the page going hidden, or a
// fallback timer set just past the animation's own duration.
//
// Everything with a side effect is injected so this can be tested in Node
// without a DOM or a frame loop.
