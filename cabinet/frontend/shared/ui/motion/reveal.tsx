   Each of the three components below resolves `as` through `asMotion`, which the
   rule reads as building a component mid-render. It is not: `asMotion` is a
   memo over a stable key and hands back the *same* component every time (see
   ./element, where the cache and the reason for it are spelled out). The failure
   the rule guards against — a fresh component type on each render, remounting
   the subtree and restarting the animation — is precisely what that cache
   exists to prevent, and there is no way to express "already memoised" to it.
   Scoped to this file because these three are the only place it applies. */

   * the element at all. uikit's components are written that way (`{ className,
   * ...props }` onto a `div`); one that dropped either would not animate, and
