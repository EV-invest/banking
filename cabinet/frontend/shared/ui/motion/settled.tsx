 * The skeleton → content handover. Every data surface in the cabinet swapped its
 * skeleton for real content in a single frame, which reads as a flicker: the eye
 * registers that *something* changed without registering *what*. Here the
 * skeleton is replaced and the content fades and rises the last few pixels into
 * its place.
 *
 * Two things it deliberately does not do:
 *
 * - **No cross-fade.** Skeleton and content would have to overlap, which means
 *   taking one out of flow and animating a height — expensive, and it makes the
 *   surface jump when the real content is a different size.
 * - **No entrance when no skeleton was shown.** Data that is already present on
 *   the first render (a cached or server-supplied value) cuts straight in;
 *   fading it would invent a delay that the data never had.
 *
 * The caller still owns the empty and error states — pass them as `children`,
 * guarded on the same condition as `loading`, and they arrive with the same
 * motion as content would.
 *
 * One more thing it does not do: travel, when the section around it is still
 * arriving. Two 8px rises composed on top of each other make the card stutter
 * as it settles, so a handover caught inside a live entrance keeps the fade and
 * drops the movement. See ./entrance.
