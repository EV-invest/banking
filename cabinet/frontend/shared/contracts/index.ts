// Clean re-exports of the proto-derived types — import from `@/shared/contracts`,
// never `./gen` directly.
//
// The backend gRPC proto (`contracts/proto`) is the single source of truth:
// `protoc-gen-connect-openapi` emits `contracts/openapi.json` from it, and
// `@hey-api/openapi-ts` emits `./gen` from that (`npm run gen:api`, or the flake
// `nix run .#gen-api`). Field names are snake_case to match the BFF's `keepCase`
// proto-loader shape, and every field is optional (proto3 JSON semantics).
//
// Money types come from banking's own proto (`BankingV1*`). The identity surface
// (profile + sessions) is served by the concierge plane, so those types come from
// concierge's OWN proto (`ConciergeV1*`) — the actual source of that wire data —
// rather than banking's byte-identical copy, so a concierge-side field change is
// surfaced by `gen-api` instead of going silently stale.
