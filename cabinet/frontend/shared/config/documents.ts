 * prefixed at render by {@link siteDocumentHref}. Constants rather than `config`: which pages the site
 * publishes is a fact about the site, not a deployment knob.

 * page that is not there is worse than no link (banking #385). Terms, privacy and a risk
 * disclosure are the ones still missing: the site has no such pages, so they are listed
 * here as absent rather than pointed at `#`.
