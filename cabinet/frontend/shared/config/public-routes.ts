// comprehension inlined in the proxy.
//
// It moved out of `proxy.ts` when the approval pages arrived, because they changed the
// shape of the question. `/login` and `/loggedout` are whole paths; an approval page is
// `/approve/<token>` — a path whose interesting part is different for every visitor, and
// which no equality test can name. The prefix rule that answers both is small enough to
// look obviously correct and consequential enough to be worth pinning down in tests, and
// `proxy.ts` itself is not reachable from the test runner (it imports `next/server`).
//
// The failure directions are not symmetric, which is why the matching is deliberately
// narrow. Too tight and a signed-out owner following a link from their mailbox is bounced
// to /login — the approval is lost, because they have no account to sign in to on that
// device and the token is single-use. Too loose and a private page is served to anyone.
// So: a public entry matches its own path exactly, or a path that continues with `/`.
// `/approvals` is a different route and stays gated; `/approve/<token>` is public;
// `/approve` itself is public and simply 404s, which is the honest answer for a link that
// arrived without its token.

 * PostHog attaches `$current_url` to every event it sends, including the pageview it fires
 * on mount; Sentry stamps the same URL onto `request.url` and onto every fetch breadcrumb.
 * Mounting either on an approval page therefore ships a live, single-use approval token to
 * two third parties, off-origin, before the reader has done anything at all.
 *
 * `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` does not help with this. That header governs the `Referer`
 * of outbound requests; it has no bearing on a URL an SDK reads out of `location` and puts
 * in a request body.
 *
 * The redaction this would otherwise call for has nowhere to live: neither
 * `@evinvest/analytics`'s `PostHogProvider` (`apiKey` / `host` / `capturePageview`) nor
 * `@evinvest/error-monitoring`'s `ErrorMonitoringProvider` (`dsn` / `environment` / sample
 * rates) exposes a `beforeSend` or sanitiser seam, and reaching past them to configure the
 * vendor SDKs by hand is exactly what AGENTS.md § Hard rules forbids. So the honest fix is
 * not to observe these two pages — which costs a pageview nobody is measuring and error
 * reports from two pages, and removes the leak outright rather than filtering it.
