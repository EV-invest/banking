// Fee rates, in the two units the cabinet speaks.
//
// The money plane stores and charges **basis points** — integers, where 10000 is 100% —
// because a rate that charges real money must be exact, and a fraction of a percent held
// as a float is not. Every human surface, though, states a rate the way a term sheet does:
// "2 and 20". So the conversion happens exactly twice, here, and both directions are
// tested — the admin form writes a policy through `toBps`, and every screen that reads one
// back displays it through `pct`.
//
// Why this is not in `money.ts`: a rate is not an amount. It never crosses the wire as a
// decimal string, it has its own resolution (two decimal places, no more and no less), and
// mixing it into the amount formatters is how a rate ends up rendered to the cent.
