// Reading a settled answer off the wire.
//
// This exists because "has this seat answered yet?" is not the question "is `decision`
// null?", and getting the two confused broke the feature completely. The money plane models
// an unanswered seat as an explicit `PENDING` state, and the BFF serialises that enum by
// name — so the field arrives as the string `"pending"`, and an absent one arrives as `""`
// rather than as JSON null. Both are truthy. A view that treats the field as nullable
// therefore reads *every fresh invitation* as already decided, and tells an owner who has
// just opened their email that they rejected a payout they have never seen.
//
// So the rule is inverted here, once, for every caller: an answer counts as settled only if
// it is one of the words that means an answer. Everything else — "pending", "", a state the
// money plane adds next year — is "not yet", which is the safe direction: the worst case is
// a vote form shown for a request the server will refuse, which produces a visible error,
// rather than a vote form silently withheld from someone entitled to use it.
//
// The removal vocabulary is doubled on purpose. The public route speaks approve/reject for
// both endpoints (the BFF maps them onto Remove/Keep), while the authenticated peer-vote
// route speaks remove/keep, and a removal's settled `decision` can reach the client through
// either. Accepting both spellings costs nothing and removes a whole class of "the button
// did nothing" bug.
