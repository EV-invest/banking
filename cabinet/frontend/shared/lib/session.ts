// Auth is shell-owned: the shared `ev_access` cookie (Path=/, host-locked) is the
// credential every zone backend verifies against the concierge JWKS, and the JWT inside
// it expires on a short TTL (minutes). The `ev_session` cookie the zone proxy gates on
// carries the whole refresh window (days) instead — so an idle tab still looks signed in
// to `proxy.ts`, renders the page, and then every `/api/*` call comes back 401
// `unauthenticated` because the access JWT lapsed underneath it.
//
// `GET /api/auth/session` (site-root — the shell's auth surface, NOT this zone's BFF) is
// the ONLY thing that re-sets that cookie from the server-side refresh token. This module
// owns that call so two callers can keep the page working without a reload: the api
// client (heals a 401 in place) and the session keeper (rotates the cookie before it
// lapses). See `shared/lib/api-client.ts` and `application/layout/session-keeper.tsx`.
