// public site hand a reader's chosen language to the cabinet.
//
// Two callers need it from the browser and neither can use the server-side
// COOKIES map:
//   - the account chip, which renders on the CONDUCTOR origin inside a custom
//     element and so has no Next request context at all;
//   - the settings language switcher, which must make its choice stick before

//
// The name is computed from the live protocol rather than from config, and that
// is not a shortcut: `__Host-` requires Secure and Secure requires https, so the
// protocol is what actually decides which name the browser will accept. It
// therefore agrees with the server's AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE-derived name on both
// hosts by construction — `__Host-ev_locale` in production, bare `ev_locale`
// over plain http in dev — and with site_conductor's `scripts/locale-cookie.ts`,
// which computes it the same way.
