// The cabinet's one answer to "when was that" for absolute stamps and deadlines.
//
// It lives in `shared/` rather than beside the governance views because three slices now
// render the same deadline — the two emailed approval pages and the owners' room — and a
// helper each would be three chances for them to disagree about what "expires in 2 days"
// means. Same argument `shared/lib/intl-locale.ts` makes for its one line.
//
// WHAT A STAMP IS HERE: unix SECONDS, as a decimal string, with "0" meaning "no stamp
// yet". That is what the wire actually carries — every timestamp in the contract is an
// `int64` (see `banking/v1/consilium.proto`, "Unix seconds; 0 while pending") and the BFF
// hands it over via `.to_string()`. This module used to parse RFC 3339 instead, which no
// caller was ever given: `new Date("1757000000")` is an Invalid Date, so every date in the
// owners' room, both approval pages and the removal/admission cards rendered "—". Nothing
// caught it because both shapes are `string`.
//
// The parsing itself lives in `shared/lib/unix-stamp.ts` — import-free, and therefore the
// one part of this that `node --test` can actually exercise. This module is the wording
// around it: locales, plurals, dashes.
//
// Plain TypeScript: no translator of its own, so anything that produces words takes the
// caller's `t`. Locale-aware formatting goes through `intlLocale`, which is where the
// cabinet decides what `en` means to `Intl`.
