// A fund's fee terms, and the rules the money plane holds a CHANGE of them to.
//
// The five fields are one statement — "2 and 20 over a 5% hurdle, on invested capital,
// annually" — and the plane never edits one leg in place (docs/FEES.md § Changing the
// terms). Three of its rules are mirrored here, not because the browser decides anything,
// but because the form has to say BEFORE the click whether the owners will be asked and
// whether a reason is therefore required. The plane's answer is the one that binds; a
// mirror that disagreed with it would only mislead, so each rule below is a transcription
// of `domain/src/fees.rs` and is pinned by `fee-terms.test.ts`.
//
// Deliberately import-free (type imports aside), for the reason `unix-stamp.ts` gives:
// `node --test` does not resolve the `@/` alias, and the rule that decides who must agree
// to a price is exactly the one that must stay testable.
