// Server-side renewal of the shell's access cookie, for `proxy.ts`.
//
// Why the proxy does this at all. A server render forwards `ev_access` to the BFF, and the
// JWT inside lapses on a short TTL (300 s deployed) while its cookie lives for the whole
// refresh window — so a tab reopened after a coffee break arrives with a cookie that is
// present and dead. The browser's `SessionKeeper` heals that, but only after hydration,
// which is too late for data the server already tried to read. Renewing here, before the
// render, lets the server read succeed on the first try.
//
// The concierge `GET /auth/session` endpoint is the only thing that renews it, and it is
// safe to call concurrently: it serialises per session and hands back the current token
// without rotating the (single-use) refresh token while the access token still has more
// than 30 s left. The single-flight below only spares it the duplicate calls one burst of
// requests (a page plus its prefetches) would make.
//
// No `next/server` import, so the test runner can reach every branch here.

 * such page per window per process. The browser's SessionKeeper renews in the meantime.
