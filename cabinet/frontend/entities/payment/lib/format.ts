// The words for a payment order's wire vocabulary — state, tier, requirement, consent —
// shared by every surface that shows an order: the console list, the owners' room, the
// emailed approvals. Each takes the caller's `t`, as `views/admin/lib/format.ts` does,
// because this is a plain module with no translator of its own.
//
// Every lookup is guarded by its table and falls back to the bare wire word: the state
// machine lives in the money plane, and a state it grows tomorrow should render as
// `reconciling`, not as `payment.state.reconciling` (see `shared/contracts/payments.ts`).
