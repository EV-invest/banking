 * The rule: nothing about a URL ever changes the account, and the account only ever
 * changes the URL when the URL was a guess.
 *
 * It used to be the other way round — any of the four prefixed locales was read as
 * "the most recent thing the reader did" and written to the account — and a shared
 * `/de/cabinet/profile` link then silently rewrote an account set to Vietnamese on
 * every device at once (#347). Settings promises "saved to your account, so every
 * device follows"; a preference that follows the reader cannot also follow the link
 * they clicked. Nor can an account with no language be seeded from a URL: the proxy
 * remembers a guessed locale in the `ev_locale` cookie, and the next unprefixed entry
 * redirects to it without the mark — so a URL that looks deliberate may be last week's
 * guess laundered through a cookie. Settings is the only writer.
 *
 * What remains is a read. The mark is matched on its value, not its presence: it
 * describes the entry that minted it, and one left behind by an earlier redirect the
 * reader never completed cannot speak for a URL it never saw. When it does name this
 * page and the account has a routable language of its own, that wins — the reader who
 * chose Deutsch on a laptop opens the cabinet in German on a phone, not in the phone's
 * OS language. A guess that matches the stored language, or meets an account with no
 * language, changes nothing.
