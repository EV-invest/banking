 *  · **no case** — offer the start; this is the only state the cabinet modelled before.
 *  · **a running case that is resumable** — still offer it. A repeat start returns the SAME
 *    vendor session rather than buying a new one (concierge#55), so the action is a "continue",
 *    and refusing it would strand a user who closed the vendor tab by accident.
 *  · **a running case that is NOT resumable** — refuse. The case is alive and holds the start
 *    gate, but nothing on the plane can send the browser back to the vendor, so a start here
 *    can only fail. That user is waiting on a decision, and the screen owes them a sentence,
 *    not a button.
 *
 * Above the entry tier there is nothing to start: `/kyc/start` opens a case for tier 1 and
 * nothing higher, so a press would spend a paid session on a verdict that cannot raise anyone.
