// The two token-addressed reads, as resources.
//
// They go through `defineResource` for the same reason every other read in this cabinet
// does: it is the one place a read is started, and it starts it from `useResource`'s
// subscription rather than from a `useEffect`. A hand-rolled fetch-on-mount is a `setState`
// running synchronously inside an effect — cascading renders, and the thing
// `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` exists to stop.
//
// Two properties of the cache matter here and are worth being explicit about, because these
// resources are keyed by a credential:
//
//   · Memory only. `persist` is off (its default), so nothing is written to
//     sessionStorage. The token lives exactly as long as the tab does, which is no longer
//     than it already lives in `window.location` and the browser's history.
//   · Re-reading is free. The GET is strictly inert — mail scanners fetch it before any
//     human does (docs/CONSILIUM.md, policy 5) — so the focus-driven revalidation that
//     comes with the cache costs a redacted summary and nothing else. It spends no token
//     and casts no vote.
//
// The revalidate window is long because nothing on these pages changes on its own: an
// invitation is settled by the reader in front of it, and the only other transition it can
// make is expiring.
