// The two token-addressed approval endpoints, reached from an owner's mailbox.
//
// These deliberately do NOT go through `shared/lib/api-client.ts`, and the reason is the
// whole character of these pages. `requestJson` is built around a session: it rotates the
// access cookie before a request that might present a stale one, and it heals a 401 by
// refreshing the session and replaying once. Every one of those steps is right for the
// signed-in cabinet and wrong here:
//
//   · There is no session. The reader followed a link from an email, quite possibly on a
//     phone that has never signed in to this cabinet at all. A pre-flight to the shell's
//     session endpoint is a round-trip that can only ever answer "no", and it makes an
//     inert, read-only page look like it is doing authentication.
//   · A 401 here is not a lapsed session. The credential on these routes is the token plus
//     the code, so healing-and-replaying would replay a *vote* against a fresh cookie —
//     and the error the reader would be shown is "Sign in again to continue", which is
//     advice they cannot take and which is not true.
//
// What IS shared is the error vocabulary: failures come back as the same `RequestError`
// every other screen reports, so `errorMessage(error, t)` translates them at the render
// boundary exactly as it does elsewhere, and no new dialect of "something went wrong"
// appears on the one surface a reader may only ever see once.
