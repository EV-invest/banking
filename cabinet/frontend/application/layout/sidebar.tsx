// One rail section: an optional eyebrow, its rows, and — while one of those rows is

// The highlight is one node per SECTION, mounted once and moved, the way the mobile tab
// bar's rule is. It used to be a `layoutId` pill inside the marked row, and that had two
// costs. The slide was a JS-driven layout projection competing for the main thread with
// the new page's render, so it dropped frames on precisely the navigation it was meant
// to smooth. And its origin was wrong: motion's page-box measurement adds `window.scroll`
// to every box unless the element itself is `position: fixed`, so the unmount snapshot
// carried the old page's scrollY while the new pill was measured after Next had scrolled
// to the top — the pill set off from `scrollY` pixels below its row. Here the move is a
// CSS transition on `transform`, which runs on the compositor and survives whatever the
// main thread is doing, and the origin is wherever the marker already is.
//
// One per section rather than one per rail for the same reason as before: a marker
// travelling from Invest to Users would cross two headings that have nothing to do with
// either row, and the distance would imply a relationship that does not exist. Crossing
// a section unmounts one marker and mounts another, which is a fade.
//
// The tab bar positions its marker by arithmetic because its tabs are uniform; rail rows
// are not — sections differ in row count and every label is a translation — so this one
// is placed by measurement. SSR cannot know those offsets, so until the first placement
// the marked row carries the fill itself (globals.css) and the marker stays hidden; one
// forced layout read per navigation is the price of the move.
//

// stacking context of its own it would land behind the rail's background instead of
// behind the row's label.
