 * happened, and setting `initial` unconditionally makes the pill fade *while it
 * slides* inside a section too. Measured: with a blanket `initial` a within-
 * section move ran 13 positions AND 12 opacity steps; the slide alone is what was

 *
 * Keyed on the path, not the section: a move inside a section leaves the section
