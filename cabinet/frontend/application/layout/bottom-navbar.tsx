          per tab that mounts and unmounts.

          The old version rendered it inside the active <Link>, which had two
          consequences. It sat at the top of the *link box*, a couple of pixels
          off the icon rather than on the bar's edge. And on any route no tab
          claims — /profile, /notifications — the index was -1, so the marker
          unmounted completely and then reappeared out of nowhere on the way
          back, with no previous position to travel from. A shared `layoutId`
          cannot paper over that: an element that does not exist has no origin.

          Mounted permanently, both problems are arithmetic instead. Position is
          `index × 100%` of its own width, and its own width is exactly one tab,
          so the two can never drift. An unclaimed route just fades it out where
          it stands, and returning fades it back in already in the right place. */}

                72.1px, "Paramètres" 65.6px — and the value this replaced, Russian
                "Инвестировать", 91.3px. That 16px is what broke the bar, because
                without `min-w-0` above the tab grew to fit rather than the label
                shrinking, and the marker is positioned as an exact fifth of the bar.
                German is the tightest case: "Einstellungen" measures 77.1px and does
                not fit, which is why `nav.settings` is "Optionen" there.
                The `title` is for assistive tech and for a desktop browser at a narrow
                width — not a touch affordance, since neither iOS nor Android surfaces
                one, and this bar is `lg:hidden`. The label is authored to fit; nothing
                here depends on the tooltip. */}
