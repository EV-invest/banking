//! What every websocket bridge in this BFF shares: the handshake's cross-site guard, the
//! close codes a client keys on, the keepalive cadence and the token-expiry clock.
//!
//! A bridge is a thin pump from one upstream server-stream to one browser socket, and
//! three rules make it safe to keep open (see [`super::governance_ws`] for the first one,
//! [`super::book_ws`] for the second):
//!
//! - **It is authorized at the handshake and only until the token says so.** `ev_access`
//!   is verified exactly as on the REST routes, and the socket closes itself when that
//!   token expires rather than outliving the session that opened it.
//! - **The handshake checks `Origin`.** A websocket handshake is exempt from the
//!   same-origin policy but still carries cookies, so without this any page could open
//!   the signed-in user's feed. This is the socket's half of what CSRF double-submit does
//!   for the mutating REST routes.
//! - **It is mounted outside the request-deadline layer** (see [`crate::routes::router`]),
//!   because that layer exists to kill a wedged request and would kill this instead.
