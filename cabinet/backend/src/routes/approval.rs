//! The PUBLIC approval surface — `/api/approval/**`, one shape over both planes.
//!
//! These four endpoints are reached from an email by someone who may not be signed in.
//! They carry NO session and require none: the emailed token IS the credential, exactly
//! as the two approval services are mounted outside their planes' user-auth layers.
//!
//! Consequences that shape everything below:
//!
//! - **The GET is strictly read-only.** Gmail, Outlook SafeLinks and corporate gateways
//!   issue automatic `GET`s for every URL in a message, so a scanner must not be able to
//!   move a consilium. The vote is a separate `POST` carrying the secret code from the
//!   same mail — that is what turns a scanned link into a deliberate human act.
//! - **No CSRF check.** Double-submit protects a session's authority from another origin;
//!   there is no session here, and the token in the path is not ambient authority a
//!   browser attaches on its own. The POST is bounded by [`AttemptLimiter`] instead.
//! - **One identical refusal.** Unknown, expired, spent, burned and wrong-state tokens
//!   must be indistinguishable — see [`opaque`].
//! - **Every response is sealed**: `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` so the token in the URL
//!   never rides a `Referer` to a third party, and `Cache-Control: no-store` so it never
//!   lands in a shared cache.
