# cabinet-backend

The cabinet's **BFF** (backend-for-frontend): a standalone, **stateless** HTTP service that
is the cabinet's egress boundary. It proxies the browser's same-origin `/api/*` JSON
requests to two gRPC planes:

- **concierge** (identity) — `UserDirectory` `GetMe`/`UpdateProfile`, the directory/platform
  admin RPCs, notifications, and the ownership plane (owners, removals, the live feed).
- **piggybank** (money) — `WalletService`, `FundsService`, `FeesService`, `AllocationsService`,
  `BookService`, `BalanceService`, `ConsiliumService`, `HealthService`.

## Auth is shell-owned

The BFF **runs no OAuth and holds no session**. The concierge auth web surface — reached
through the conductor's `/api/auth/*` on the shared origin — signs the user in and sets the
zone-shared `ev_access` JWT cookie. This service only **verifies** that cookie, locally,
against the concierge JWKS (cached from the plane's public `Jwks` RPC, so there is no
per-request round trip; it fails closed until the plane publishes keys). That verified
cookie IS the request's credential.

There is no session store, no opaque session cookie, and no `oauth.rs`. The one piece of
server-side state left is `session.rs`'s per-user **cache** of banking money tokens, which
a lost entry simply re-mints.

Cookies read (never set): `ev_access` (the access JWT) and `ev_csrf` (the readable
double-submit token, echoed in `x-ev-csrf` on every mutation). Both are `__Host-`-prefixed
in production.

## Layout

| Module | Role |
| ------ | ---- |
| `config.rs` | the `ev::settings!` env surface — the deploy contract, pinned by tests |
| `state.rs` | `AppState` + `Grpc` (lazy channels + typed client calls to both planes) |
| `session.rs` | the per-user banking money-token cache + single-flight refresh |
| `cookies.rs` | the cookie names the BFF reads (must match the shell's) |
| `governance.rs` | the concierge ownership-plane seam — see the pin note below |
| `deployments.rs` | the admin deployments page's two sources: the mounted deployed-versions directory and the GitHub API, with the in-process cache — see below |
| `dto.rs` | browser-facing JSON DTOs (snake_case; 64-bit values as strings) |
| `error.rs` | gRPC status → HTTP status + `{ "error": … }` body |
| `routes/` | one handler per endpoint: `identity`, `money`, `book`, `admin`, `notifications`, `platform`, `system`, `consilium`, `payments`, `approval`; the two socket bridges `governance_ws` and `book_ws` over the shared `ws` (origin guard, close codes, keepalive, expiry) |

## The governance surface

Two things must never be one person's decision — paying the fund's own revenue out, and
taking an owner's seat away. Both are gated by a **consilium**; `docs/CONSILIUM.md` is the
policy and the threat model. A **payment** — an order between two named ends of the
platform — is gated the same way: the plane seats the one approval the order needs on
open (the owners' consilium for a fund-owned source, the investor's own consent for a
user-owned one), so the payments console has no approve or execute verb; the answer comes
from a mailbox through `/api/approval/**`.

| Route | Plane | Token |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `GET /api/consilium`, `GET /api/consilium/{id}` | money | banking |
| `POST /api/consilium/revenue-payout`, `POST /api/consilium/{id}/cancel` | money | banking |
| `GET /api/owners`, `POST /api/owners/resign` | ownership | concierge |
| `GET`/`POST /api/owners/removals`, `POST /api/owners/removals/{id}/vote`, `…/cancel` | ownership | concierge |
| `GET`/`POST /api/owners/admissions`, `POST /api/owners/admissions/{id}/vote`, `…/cancel` | ownership | concierge |
| `GET /api/owners/consilium/ws` | ownership | concierge |
| `GET`/`POST /api/admin/payments`, `GET /api/admin/payments/{id}`, `…/cancel` | money | banking (Admin\|Owner) |
| `GET`/`POST /api/approval/{payout,removal,consent}/{token}` | money / ownership / money | none — the emailed token |

The split is architectural: the money plane must be able to audit its own authorization, so
its tally is computed against the owner roster it already mirrors; ownership is a
concierge-owned fact, so only that plane may mutate it. Each handler forwards its own
plane's token and never the other's.

**Admission is governed too**, and it is why the rest holds: granting a seat needs
unanimity of every other owner, and it is the ONLY way `Role::Owner` is granted — the
directory's `SetRole` refuses it outside an executed admission. Without that, a bad actor
would mint sock puppets *before* opening an invoice and then reach quorum legitimately,
which snapshotting the roster cannot prevent because the stuffing already happened.
Admission and removal share one governance revision, so the socket follows both. Note the
two votes have deliberately different vocabularies — `admit`/`reject` against
`remove`/`keep` — because a page that rendered the wrong verb would still submit.

**The websocket** bridges `GovernanceService.WatchGovernance` to the browser — one revision covers removals and
admissions together, so a single subscription follows the whole ownership surface. A frame
carries a revision and a timestamp — never a tally, never a secret — and the client
refetches the authoritative snapshot when the revision moves. It verifies `ev_access` at
the handshake exactly as the REST routes do, checks the handshake `Origin` against
`CABINET_WS_ORIGIN` (a websocket handshake is exempt from CORS but still carries cookies),
and closes itself when the token expires. It is mounted **outside** the router's
request-deadline layer, which exists to kill a wedged request and would otherwise kill this
every 15 seconds.

## The book surface

The secondary market in an allocation's units — holders trading with each other on the
hub's central limit order book (`BookService`; the policy and the ledger model are in
`piggybank/core/PATTERNS.md` § The book). Every route is a money-plane route: it forwards
the banking token, and an order is an escrow inside the ledger. Reads answer a fixed
generic message on failure; mutations relay the hub's client-safe wording under the mapped
status (`FAILED_PRECONDITION` → 412 for a closed book or an access below `invest`,
`INVALID_ARGUMENT` → 400, `ALREADY_EXISTS` → 409 for a reused `client_order_id`,
`NOT_FOUND` → 404 for a hidden allocation). The string vocabularies — `side`, `kind`,
`tif`, `resolution` — are pinned in `evbanking_contracts::book` and checked here, so a
client bug is refused with the words that would have worked before the hub is called.
Every amount, size, price, timestamp and revision crosses as a string.

| Route | Query / body | Answer | Gates |
| ----- | ------------ | ------ | ----- |
| `GET /api/book` | `service`, `depth?` | `BookSnapshot` | session |
| `GET /api/book/trades` | `service`, `limit?` | `{ trades: Trade[] }` — the public tape, no parties | session |
| `GET /api/book/candles` | `service`, `resolution`, `from?`, `to?` (unix s; `to` absent = now) | `{ service, resolution, candles: Candle[] }` | session |
| `GET /api/book/policy` | `service` | `BookPolicy` | session |
| `GET /api/book/orders` | `service?` (absent = every allocation) | `{ orders: Order[] }` — resting, oldest first | session |
| `GET /api/book/orders/history` | `service?`, `limit?` | `{ orders: Order[] }` — every state, newest first | session |
| `GET /api/book/fills` | `service?`, `limit?` | `{ trades: Trade[] }` — own fills with side, order and fee | session |
| `POST /api/book/orders` | `{ service, side, kind, tif?, price?, size, client_order_id }` | `Order` | session + CSRF |
| `POST /api/book/orders/cancel` | `{ order_id }` | `Order` | session + CSRF |
| `GET /api/book/ws` | `service`, `depth?` | websocket, see below | session + `Origin` |
| `POST /api/admin/allocations/book` | `{ service, book_open, taker_fee_bps, price_tick?, lot_size?, market_slippage_bps? }` | `BookPolicy` | admin + CSRF |

**The book websocket** bridges `BookService.WatchBook` exactly as the governance one does
(same handshake, origin guard, keepalive, expiry and close codes — the shared `routes/ws`),
but its frame IS the book: `{ "type": "book", snapshot: BookSnapshot, trades: Trade[],
orders_revision }` — the same snapshot `GET /api/book` answers, the latest public trades,
and the revision at which the caller's own orders last changed, so the client refetches
`/api/book/orders` only when `orders_revision` moves. Every 25 s a `{ "type":
"heartbeat", at }` keeps the socket alive and carries no book. No other user's orders and
no balances ride on it. Close codes: `1000` the feed ended (reconnect; the first frame of
the new subscription is a full snapshot), `4401` the access token expired (sign in again),
`4503` the hub could not serve the feed (poll instead).

**`/api/approval/{payout,removal}/{token}`** is the surface an emailed owner reaches. It
carries no session and requires none — the emailed token is the credential — so it is the
one part of this service with no cookie and no CSRF check. The `GET` is strictly read-only
because mail scanners fetch every URL in a message; the vote is a `POST` carrying the
secret code from the same mail. Every response sends `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` and
`Cache-Control: no-store`, and every unusable token — unknown, expired, spent, burned,
wrong-state — produces one identical 404, so the endpoint cannot be used to probe which is
which. The POST is bounded by a small in-process per-IP limiter; the real anti-brute-force
bound is the plane's five-attempt token burn.

## The cap table

An operator's supply surface for one product, over `AllocationsService`. Units cross as
decimal strings; every `POST` needs the admin session plus CSRF and forwards the banking
money token. `UnitIssuance` is one shape for the three writes — `source` says whether
the row grew the supply (`mint`), moved units out of the company's stake (`company`,
supply unchanged) or burnt them (`retire`, supply shrank); `units` is always the
magnitude. `state` is `queued` until the hub's relay posts the leg, then `applied`.

| Route | Query / body | Answer | Gates |
| ----- | ------------ | ------ | ----- |
| `GET /api/admin/allocations/holders` | `service` | `UnitHolders` — `units_outstanding`, `company_units`, `fee_units`, `investor_units`, `queued_units` (mints not yet posted — do not pin the cap while non-zero) | admin |
| `POST /api/admin/allocations/issue` | `{ service, units, idempotency_key, cost_basis?, user_id \| company: true }` | `UnitIssuance` (`source: "mint"`) | admin + CSRF |
| `POST /api/admin/allocations/transfer-stake` | `{ service, user_id, units, idempotency_key, cost_basis? }` | `UnitIssuance` (`source: "company"`, `holder_kind: "user"`) | admin + CSRF |
| `POST /api/admin/allocations/retire` | `{ service, units, idempotency_key, cost_basis?, force?, user_id \| company: true }` | `UnitIssuance` (`source: "retire"`, positive `units`) | admin + CSRF |
| `POST /api/admin/allocations/backing` | `{ service, backing }` — `cash \| in_kind` | `Allocation` | admin + CSRF |

`idempotency_key` (1..64 chars) is the retry contract, one key space per product across
the three writes: the console generates one per form submission and re-sends the same
one on a timeout, so a double click lands one row. A repeat of the same request answers
the row as it stands (`200`); the same key for a different request — a mint and then a
hand-over included — is `409`. `cost_basis` absent or empty defaults hub-side to
`units × NAV` at the dealing mark. A hand-over of more than the company holds, a mint
past the unit cap, or a retirement of more than the holder has AVAILABLE (units resting
on the book or reserved by a redemption do not count) is `400`; an unknown `service` or
`user_id` is `404`. A retirement out of a product that is not `closed` is `412` unless
the body carries `force: true`.

`Allocation.backing` (`cash` | `in_kind`) says what stands behind the units. The hub
flips a product to `in_kind` on its first mint; `/allocations/backing` is how an operator
says the fund now holds cash for the units — or corrects a product back. While a product
is `in_kind`, `POST /api/funds/redeem` on it is `412` with the hub's reason (holders exit
through the book instead); the client draws the redeem control off `backing`, never off
`state` alone.

## Run

`nix run .#cabinet-backend`. It needs the piggybank hub (`nix run .#piggybank`, or `.#dev`);
identity flows additionally need the concierge runner, started from the sibling `concierge`
repo, and a signed-in browser session from the shell's auth surface. Every port comes from
the flake's `ports` attrset; secrets and per-machine overrides live in `.env.example` (copy
to `.env`).

## What is deployed

`GET /api/admin/deployments` (console gate — any non-investor) answers which version of
every component runs in production and how far behind its repository it is. The ground
truth is the deployed-versions ConfigMap Flux mounts into the pod at
`DEPLOYED_VERSIONS_DIR` (default `/etc/ev/deployed-versions`): one `<name>.image` (the
full image reference, tag included) and, optionally, one `<name>.repo` (the source
repository URL) per component. The directory is listed, never consulted for expected
names, so a new component appears the moment gitops adds its pair. No directory, or no
`.image` in it, is the local case and answers `available: false` with a `200`.

For each GitHub repository the page asks the public API once per (repository, tag) for
the tag's commit and pull request — a fact that never changes, so it is cached for the
process lifetime — and per repository for the newest `vX.Y.Z` tag (pre-releases
ignored), re-asked every ten minutes. GitHub lists tags by name, not by version, so the
listing is followed page by page (100 tags each) through its `Link: rel="next"` chain,
at most five pages deep. Four banking images at one tag cost one lookup.
A failure (network, an exhausted anonymous budget) is remembered for two minutes and
degrades the row (`release`/`latest_tag` null, `github_error` set) rather than the page.
`GITHUB_TOKEN` is optional; the repositories are public and, at under 100 tags each,
the cache keeps the anonymous 60 requests/hour budget sufficient. Past 100 tags a
repository costs up to five requests per refresh — 30/hour with the page reloaded
every ten minutes, so two large repositories could exhaust the anonymous budget — and
the token (5000/hour) becomes the right answer.

## Checking the deploy contract

`cabinet-backend --print-required-vars[=PROFILE]` prints the variables a profile must
provide. The gitops preflight runs it against the built image and diffs it with the cluster
Secret's keys, so a missing variable is caught before the rollout rather than as a
`CrashLoopBackOff` after it. Production additionally requires `SENTRY_DSN` (errors must
reach someone) and `CABINET_WS_ORIGIN` (the socket's cross-site guard must not fail open).
