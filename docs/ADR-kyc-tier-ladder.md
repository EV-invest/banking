# ADR — the KYC ladder, and where partner / company partner / service belong

**Status:** proposed. Awaiting the product owner's answer on the one question in
§ "The decision". Nothing below has been implemented, and nothing should be until the
answer lands — the answer decides whether most of the work happens at all.

**Issue:** [#214](https://github.com/EV-invest/banking/issues/214). Related: #179
(where the `>= 1` gate actually sits), #195 (limits are not attached to a tier at all),
#213 (the onboarding UI that would have to grow).

## Context — what `kyc_level` is today

`kyc_level` is a `uint32` on `banking.v1.UserProfile`
(`contracts/proto/banking/v1/users.proto:85`), with the rungs written as prose in the
comment above it (`:72-84`). It is **not** an enum, so the wire carries any number the
plane will store.

The identity plane owns the value and is its only writer: concierge
`domain/src/users.rs:37` caps it at `MAX_KYC_LEVEL = 3`, `runner/src/directory.rs:302`
re-checks the same bound on the `SetKycLevel` RPC, and
`runner/migrations/0013_kyc_level_range.sql:81-84` puts `CHECK (kyc_level BETWEEN 0 AND 3)`
on `users` (validated) and on `user_outbox` (deliberately and permanently `NOT VALID`).
A vendor verdict may grant at most tier 1 (`runner/src/ports.rs:241`,
`PROVIDER_MAX_TIER`), and a provider may only be *asked* for 1 or 2
(`runner/migrations/0010_kyc_cases.sql:46`, with `0014_kyc_requested_tier_intent.sql`
explaining why those two numbers differ on purpose). Banking mirrors the value over the
one-way lifecycle bridge and never authors it; its own ceiling lives in the cabinet BFF
(`cabinet/backend/src/routes/admin.rs:62`) and in the operator console
(`cabinet/frontend/views/admin/lib/format.ts:76`, `KYC_LEVELS = [0, 1, 2, 3]`, with
`KYC_LEVEL_KEYS` at `:109-114` and the `Select` over them at
`cabinet/frontend/views/admin/users/ui/users-view.tsx:426-430`).

**The enforced surface is one comparison, repeated three times.** Everything reads
`>= KYC_LEVEL_VERIFIED` (= 1):

- `piggybank/core/src/application/wallet.rs:137` (`is_verified`), reached from
  `get_deposit_address` at `:257` — no deposit **address is issued** below tier 1.
- `piggybank/core/src/application/withdrawals.rs` — a withdrawal request is refused, and
  the tier is checked **again at dispatch**, because acceptance and payout can be hours
  apart.

Nothing anywhere reads `>= 2` or `>= 3`. Tiers 2 and 3 exist on paper and grant nothing
the code can observe; the proto comment says of tier 2's raised limits, in as many words,
that the limits themselves are not modelled yet. See also #179: the `>= 1` arm on the
deposit side gates **provisioning an address**, not the crediting of money that arrives on
one already issued — whatever a new rung is given, it inherits that placement.

## The decision

> Do we extend the scalar to `0..6`, or keep `kyc_level` as a measure of verification
> depth and put partner / company partner / service on a different axis?

**Recommendation: Option B — a different axis.** `partner`, `company partner` and
`service` become **roles** (or, if the role axis turns out to be the wrong home, a
`subject_type` attribute alongside it). `kyc_level` keeps meaning exactly one thing: how
thoroughly the subject behind the account has been checked.

Three reasons, in the order they will bite:

1. **`>=` would grant things nobody decided to grant.** Every gate over `kyc_level` is
   written as `>=`, so on the day the ceiling constant changes, a `service` (6) clears
   every gate an `elevated` individual (3) clears — today that reads "a machine API client
   may move money in and out", for free, with no line of code expressing the decision.
   The ordering is load-bearing and the three proposed rungs are not ordered against the
   existing ones.
2. **The ordering claim would be false.** "A company partner is verified more thoroughly
   than an individual who passed enhanced due diligence" is not a claim anyone would make,
   but it is exactly what the number encodes and what a future `>=` reads back out. A
   `u32` cannot warn the next gate author that its ordering is decorative.
3. **The axis already exists.** `string role = 17` sits in the same message
   (`contracts/proto/banking/v1/users.proto:86`), with its own RPC
   (`concierge` `contracts/proto/concierge/v1/directory.proto:67`, `SetRole`), its own
   admin vocabulary (`ASSIGNABLE_ROLES` / `ROLES` at
   `cabinet/frontend/views/admin/lib/format.ts:52,62`) and an owner consilium behind it.
   Partner, company partner and service are answers to "what kind of subject is this",
   which is the question `role` is for.

**Corollary for level 6 (service).** A machine client has no "how thoroughly was this
human checked" to record. What it needs is a **credential type and an access scope** —
which is how tokens already work in the identity plane, not how KYC tiers work. Modelling
a service as a KYC tier would mean issuing it a document-verification level it can never
have obtained. Under this recommendation `service` is not a tier and not, strictly, a
person-role either: it is a credential with a scope, and it should be designed as one.

### The decision table the issue asks for

Filled in with the recommended answer. "Permits" is the *enforced* permission — what code
reads — not an aspiration.

| Level | What is verified | What it permits | Limits | Who may assign |
| ----- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------ | -------------- |
| 0 registered | confirmed email only | nothing that moves money | n/a | automatic on sign-up |
| 1 verified | document, liveness, face match, sanctions/PEP | deposit **address issuance**, withdrawal request, withdrawal dispatch | none today — see below | vendor verdict (`PROVIDER_MAX_TIER = 1`) or a human operator |
| 2 enhanced | proof of address, source of funds | same as 1, plus a raised transaction ceiling once limits exist | **owner decision needed** (#195) | human operator only |
| 3 elevated | enhanced due diligence | same as 2, plus whatever the top limit band is | **owner decision needed** | human reviewer only, never automatic |
| ~~4 partner~~ | — | **not a `kyc_level`** under this recommendation | — | — |
| ~~5 company partner~~ | — | **not a `kyc_level`** | — | — |
| ~~6 service~~ | — | **not a `kyc_level`** | — | — |

Rows 4-6 move to a second table, on the axis that actually asks "what kind of subject is
this":

| Subject | Axis | What it is | What it would permit | Who may assign |
| ------- | ---- | ---------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| partner | `role` | a partner who is a natural person | a partner surface (to be specified); money movement still requires `kyc_level >= 1` on the same account | owner consilium, as `SetRole` already is |
| company partner | `role` (+ an organisation record, if one is ever needed) | a partner that is an organisation | as above; KYC of the organisation is KYB and is a separate depth scale, not a rung of this one | owner consilium |
| service | credential + scope | a machine API client | exactly the scopes on its credential, nothing inherited from a tier | owner, by issuing the credential |

Two things this table makes explicit that the scalar hid:

- **A partner still has a `kyc_level`.** Being a partner does not verify anybody; a
  partner who must move money passes the same tier-1 gate every other person passes. Under
  Option A that fact disappears, because 4 is already `>= 1`.
- **A service has no `kyc_level` at all** — its account is not a verified human, and
  `0` is the honest value to store if a row must exist.

## Consequences

**If B is accepted:**

- No widening migration. `0013_kyc_level_range.sql` stays as it is, `MAX_KYC_LEVEL`
  stays 3, `KYC_LEVELS` stays `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, and the `admin.kyc.*` strings in the five
  catalogs stay four.
- The work moves to the role axis: naming the new roles, deciding what a partner surface
  is, and designing the service credential + scope. The `>=` gates keep meaning exactly
  what they mean today, and no existing comparison has to be re-read.
- The open limits question (#195, and the blank cells above) is **not** closed by this
  ADR and does not depend on it. Limits attach to `kyc_level`; that is true under either
  option.

**If A is chosen instead** (the owner may still prefer it — it is cheaper up front), then
three things become mandatory, not optional:

1. Every existing `>=` comparison is re-read and re-decided against the new rungs, and the
   proto comment states explicitly what `>=` means above 3 — or states that the ordering
   above 3 is meaningless, which every future gate author then has to know.
2. A **new** migration widens the range; `0013_kyc_level_range.sql` must not be edited
   (sqlx checksums applied migrations and they run at service start), and the widening
   must preserve the `NOT VALID` shape of the `user_outbox` constraint.
3. The contract is generated: a `users.proto` edit requires `nix run .#gen-api` and both
   sides committed together (`contracts/openapi.json` and
   `cabinet/frontend/shared/contracts/gen/`), or the two planes drift apart silently.

## What is still open after this ADR

1. **The limits model.** Tiers 2 and 3 grant nothing until a limit band is attached to a
   tier and read somewhere. Owner decision, tracked in #195.
2. **The partner surface.** "Partner" has no behaviour in the platform yet; the role is
   only worth adding once something reads it.
3. **KYB.** A company partner's verification depth is an organisation's, not a person's.
   If it is ever needed it is a second depth scale, and reusing `kyc_level` for it would
   repeat exactly the mistake this ADR declines to make.
