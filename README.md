`banking` is the central public hub of the `EV Investment` platform — the one process
that owns the money, the identities, and the contracts. A Cargo + Turborepo
monorepo: a Rust gRPC hub (`piggybank`) and Next.js clients over a shared,
wasm-safe `domain` crate. Every other service lives in its own repo and talks
**only to the hub, over gRPC** — never to another service.

## Usage
### Layout

| Path | What | Stack | Details |
| ---- | ---- | ----- | ------- |
| [`piggybank/core/`](piggybank/core) | hub server — gRPC services + composition root | Rust · tonic · sqlx (Postgres) · TigerBeetle | [piggybank/](piggybank) |
| [`piggybank/auth/`](piggybank/auth) | auth service + shared verification flow | Rust · tonic · JWKS | — |
| [`contracts/`](contracts) | gRPC wire contracts (`proto/` → tonic stubs) | Rust · tonic-build · proto3 | — |
| [`domain/`](domain) | shared domain types (pure, wasm-safe) over `ev::architecture` | Rust | — |
| [`cabinet/`](cabinet) | host shell + BFF + microfrontend runtime | Next.js 16 · TS · Tailwind | [README](cabinet/README.md) |

`domain` is the shared source of truth for types — the hub and every service repo
depend on it, never on each other. `contracts` (vendoring `proto/`) is the single
gRPC dependency other repos import; the published `@evinvest/uikit` is the shared
design source of truth for the clients. There is **no HTTP on the hub** — browser
traffic reaches it through the `cabinet` BFF, which proxies HTTP↔gRPC.

### Run

Every app is a flake app. `nix run` resolves the repo root at runtime, so there's
no need to enter the dev shell first.

| Command | Brings up | Port |
| ------- | --------- | ---- |
| `nix run .#dev` | everything: Postgres + TigerBeetle + Redis + piggybank + cabinet | — |
| `nix run .#piggybank` | hub server: core gRPC + auth tasks (tonic-web) | `:50051` core · `:50052` auth |
| `nix run .#cabinet` | Next.js host shell + BFF | 3000 |
| `nix run .#db` | local Postgres (cluster under `.pg/`, trust auth) | 5432 |
| `nix run .#tb` | local TigerBeetle (data under `.tb/`, single replica) | 3033 |
| `nix run .#redis` | local Redis (central auth refresh-token store) | 6379 |

`.#dev` starts Postgres first and waits for it before launching the rest; one
Ctrl-C tears the whole stack down. Per-area build, test, and layout details live
in each folder's README — see the table above.

A dev shell with the full toolchain (Rust nightly + `wasm32`, Node, Postgres,
TigerBeetle, Redis, protobuf) is auto-activated by `.envrc` +
direnv, or via `nix develop`.

## Design

All UI lives in one Figma file (`e0V2P1cQpEFRuXTeNtEMh6`) — a dark-navy system in **Inter**, every value bound to `ev/color` · `ev/semantic` · `ev/radius` variables and shipped to clients as `@evinvest/uikit`.

| Surface | What | Figma |
| ------- | ---- | ----- |
| uikit | EV UIKit — tokens + component library (shadcn-class) | [node 10-2](https://www.figma.com/design/e0V2P1cQpEFRuXTeNtEMh6/Main?node-id=10-2) |
| cabinet | Investor portal — `cabinet` host shell: **Banking** nav + **Products** (mounted service MFEs) + per-service surfaces; desktop + mobile | [node 75-3](https://www.figma.com/design/e0V2P1cQpEFRuXTeNtEMh6/Main?node-id=75-3) |
| admin | Operator console over the central hub (`piggybank`) + microservices — fleet health, users, MFE registry, feature flags; desktop + mobile | [node 346-27](https://www.figma.com/design/e0V2P1cQpEFRuXTeNtEMh6/Main?node-id=346-27) |

Admin surfaces **Sentry** (errors + tracing across hub and services) and **PostHog** (product analytics, feature flags, A/B experiments).
